  <description>The new character options presented in this month's Unearthed Arcana showcase a simple design approach to adventure on the high seas. These rules include new options for the Fighting Style, Roguish Archetype, and Sorcerous Origin class features, as well as a playable minotaur race from Dragonlance's world of Krynn. Created to be specifically useful for nautical D&amp;D campaigns, these rules are general enough that they can be useful in any campaign.</description>
