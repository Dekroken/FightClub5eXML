    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Whenever you hit an object with this weapon, the hit is a critical hit.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Haladie are double-bladed polearms that rely on the user's dexterity to keep them in constant motion. 

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

Whenever you hit an object with this weapon, the hit is a critical hit.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Whenever you hit an object with this weapon, the hit is a critical hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	As an action, you can unleash a 60-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

This weapon is adorned with small black spikes that seem to soak up any blood that splashes across them. This acts as a +1 weapon and provides you with 1d8 temporary hit points whenever you reduce a Dragon, Giant, Humanoid or Monstrosity to 0 hit points.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

This weapon is adorned with small black spikes that seem to soak up any blood that splashes across them. This acts as a +1 weapon and provides you with 1d8 temporary hit points whenever you reduce a Dragon, Giant, Humanoid or Monstrosity to 0 hit points.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This weapon is adorned with small black spikes that seem to soak up any blood that splashes across them. This acts as a +1 weapon and provides you with 1d8 temporary hit points whenever you reduce a Dragon, Giant, Humanoid or Monstrosity to 0 hit points.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Chaos Weapon Effects:

1 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Chaos Weapon Effects:

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This weapon is made out of cold iron, which is toxic to fey creatures. When you hit a fey creature with this weapon, it deals an extra 1d6 force damage. The fey also has disadvantage on saving throws to avoid being banished or otherwise returned to the feywild until the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

Slumbering (Uncommon): Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Stirring (Rare): The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Wakened (Very Rare): The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ascendant (Legendary): The Ascendant weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring and Wakened properties. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 3d6.
	The cone of destructive energy the weapon creates increases to a 60-foot cone, the save DC increases to 18, and the damage increases to 12d6.

Slumbering (Uncommon): Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Stirring (Rare): The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Wakened (Very Rare): The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ascendant (Legendary): The Ascendant weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring and Wakened properties. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 3d6.
	The cone of destructive energy the weapon creates increases to a 60-foot cone, the save DC increases to 18, and the damage increases to 12d6.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

Reload: 6
Misfire: 1
Ammunition: 4g (20)

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This weapon loses its enchantment bonus permanently if it is exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

An ostentatiously ornate tommybow, the goldleaf bows are decorated with an array of bedazzling jewels. Rubies and sapphires sparkle with the fire and ice of the Hells, emeralds carry a vitriolic venom, and the diamonds glow with warm, bright sunlight, a delight peculiar to the pygmy rakshasa.
	This tommybow consists of five vertically stacked bows, each of which sports a pair of matched, randomly determined gemstones. Roll a d4 to determine each bow's gemstone pairs: 1, diamonds; 2, emeralds; 3, rubies; 4, sapphires.

Rakshasa's Revenge: You can use an action to imbue a piece of ammunition with one of the following spells (save DC 15) and fire the ammunition at a point or target within range: daylight (diamond), fireball (ruby), sleet storm (sapphire), or stench (emerald). When the ammunition hits a target or surface, it unleashes the imbued spell centered on that point. These spells do not require concentration. You can choose to fire at a point on a surface or at a target; if you miss the target, the effect is centred on whichever surface the ammunition hits (GM's discretion). The gems are destroyed when the spell is cast and their pieces fall to the ground.

Recharge: You can spend 1 minute replacing a pair of gemstones with diamonds, emeralds, rubies, or sapphires worth at least 100 gp each. So long as the gemstones are matching, then, at the next dawn, they sparkle with arcane power and can be used to imbue the bolts with the associated spells.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.

Any humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

This weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.

Any humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with lycan weapons cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Haladie are double-bladed polearms that rely on the user's dexterity to keep them in constant motion. 

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This weapon is bedecked in ornate gold filigree and deep-blue and maroon jewels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation and Persuasion skills if you don't already have it.

Spellcasting: The weapon has 5 charges. You can use a bonus action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16): Command (1 charge), Zone of Truth (2 charges), Compulsion (4 charges), Banishment (4 charges), or Dominate Person (5 charges).
	The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. If a weapon normally has the Heavy property, the mithral version doesn't. If a weapon normally has the Finesse property, the mithral version also has the Light property.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. If a weapon normally has the Heavy property, the mithral version doesn't. If a weapon normally has the Finesse property, the mithral version also has the Light property.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This elegant weapon is adorned with engravings depicting leaping dolphins and drifting jellyfish. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and you ignore the normal penalties on ranged weapon attacks while using this weapon underwater. While holding the weapon in front of you with both hands, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

Additionally, while you hold the weapon, you can use an action to cast the water breathing spell. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Haladie are double-bladed polearms that rely on the user's dexterity to keep them in constant motion.

To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and you ignore the normal penalties on ranged weapon attacks while using this weapon underwater.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This magic weapon has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While this weapon is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

	• You can breathe water.
	• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Ruidium Strike: A creature you hit with this weapon takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.

Ruidium Corruption: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a ruidium weapon becomes a +2 weapon.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

Originally fashioned for low-accuracy ride-by assassinations in urban settings, this magical tommybow retains its predecessors'
ability to self-load bolts from an attached magazine, while magically enhancing the attacks to spray splinters of wood and metal towards a target.
	This magical tommybow has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Splinterspray: As an action, you can pull the trigger extra hard, spending 1 charge, and causing the ammunition to splinter into thousands of woodand-metal shards. Instead of the normal attack against a single target, make separate attack rolls against two creatures within 5 feet of each other. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to 3d4 (plus any modifiers normally added).

    <text>Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

Originally fashioned for low-accuracy ride-by assassinations in urban settings, this magical tommybow retains its predecessors'
ability to self-load bolts from an attached magazine, while magically enhancing the attacks to spray splinters of wood and metal towards a target.
	This magical tommybow has 12 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Splinterspray: As an action, you can pull the trigger extra hard, spending 1 charge, and causing the ammunition to splinter into thousands of woodand-metal shards. Instead of the normal attack against a single target, make separate attack rolls against two creatures within 5 feet of each other. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to 4d4 (plus any modifiers normally added).

Reload (3): After you make three attacks with this weapon, you must reload it using an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

    <text>Magitech firearms use a small arcanomagnetic engine to propel their ferrous projectiles at incredible velocities. Though their means of propulsion is magical, the damage they deal remains nonmagical. Such firearms are always loud and tend to have poor accuracy over long ranges, although the recently-introduced rifling found in revolvers and rifles increases their effective range.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can't do so again until the following dusk.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

— Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

- Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon.

On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can't do so again until the following dusk.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Extra Reloads: More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

When you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 slashing damage.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

When you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 slashing damage.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.

Reload: 6
Misfire: 1
Ammunition: 4g (20)
Proficiency: firearms

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

Proficiency: martial, nunchucks
