    <text>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +5 to hit, deal 1d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.
	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with melee attacks using this weapon.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +8 to hit, deal 1d12 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: martial, rapier

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +9 to hit, deal 2d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. For 1 minute, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of the spell, you fall.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear's spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Solar Beam property and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Daylight: When you take the Attack action, you can use one attack to fire a radiant arrow from this bow at a surface within the bow's range and expend 1 charge. A magical effect identical to the daylight spell manifests for 1 hour, centred wherever the arrow strikes the surface.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Daylight and Solar Beam properties and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

It also exudes a corrosive acid that can be a useful addition when the musician's plan to charm a foe with a sweet serenade doesn't go to plan.
	This magic weapon deals an additional 1d8 acid damage to the first target that it hits on a turn. If you have proficiency with lutes, you're considered proficient with this weapon as well.
	The lute has the Club Music property.

Ventriloquism: As a bonus action while holding the lute, you can command it to mimic simple sounds it has been exposed to, such as a person whispering, swords clashing, or simple melodies. You can choose for the sounds to originate from any point within 30 feet of you that you can see. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Club Music: As an action while holding the lute, you can play one of two brief but powerful songs. Once a song has been played, you can't play that song again until the next dawn.

	â€¢ 1. Panic! at the Tavern: You let loose a fast, chaotic melody that sows panic in the minds of your foes, forcing each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can hear you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	â€¢ 2. Mithrallica: You unleash an ear-shattering power chord that blows your foes away, forcing each creature in a 25-foot cone to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you, knocked prone, and deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deafened condition on itself on a success.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Burning with ravenous hunger and unquenchable hanger, this mimic-infused weapon struggles relentlessly against the sturdy iron chains that bind it. Loosening the chains stimulates the weapon's digestive juices which, if not quenched, can have caustic consequences for its wielder.

Mimic Unleashed: As a bonus action while holding the hammer, you can loosen the chains restraining the mimic, leaving it free to mercilessly maul your foes. While the chains are loose, the hammer bites targets that it hits, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage.
	If you end your turn holding the hammer while the chains are loose, and you didn't hit a creature with an attack using the hammer that turn, the hammer's excess digestive juices pour down the handle and you take 1d4 acid damage. The chains tighten on their own if the hammer isn't held for 1 minute or if you use a bonus action to tighten the chains while holding the weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

Fashioned from the claws and shard-scales of a magnetite dragon, this protective armor can become temporarily weightless when exposed to extreme cold. The wearer of this armor can exert minor control over ferrous metals within a close proximity. While you wear this armor, you have resistance to cold damage
	This armor has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Arcanomagnetic Repulsion: You can expend 1 charge to create one of the following effects while you wear this armor.

	â€¢ Repulse: When you are targeted by a weapon attack using a ferrous weapon or ammunition, you can use your reaction to cause a pulse of arcanomagnetism to throw the weapon or ammunition off course, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.

	â€¢ Aura: As a bonus action, you can create an arcanomagnetic aura with a 30-foot radius centered on you that moves with you and that lasts until the start of your next turn. This area is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice that are made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Superconductor: Whenever you take cold damage while you wear this armor, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <text>This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

    <text>This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, increase the bonus to +3.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 600 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Huge or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

OA: Magnetic Shockwave: Once per turn when you hit a target with haemstrike, you can cause an eruption of supercooled magnetite shards. Each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor have disadvantage on this saving throw.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>The wood and iron of this once-pristine axe have been utterly devoured and replaced by a variety of fruiting fungi. Gills funnel along the axe's blade, holding millions of spores in biomantic suspension, ready to unleash their pain-inhibiting effects when inhaled.

Painblind Spores: As a bonus action while holding this axe, you can inhale its spores, numbing your extremities and stimulating muscle recruitment. Until the start of your next turn, melee weapon attacks you make with this weapon have a +2 bonus to damage rolls and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
	If you use your bonus action to inhale more spores at the beginning of your next turn, the effects continue without interruption. You can prolong the effects in this manner for up to 1 minute, after which the effects end. When the effects end, you become poisoned for a number of minutes equal to ten times the number of rounds you were under the influence of the spores. Once you have benefitted from the Painblind Spores, you can't benefit from them again until after you finish a long rest.
