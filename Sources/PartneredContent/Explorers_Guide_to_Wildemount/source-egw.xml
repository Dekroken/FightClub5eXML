  <description>Create your own Critical Role campaigns with this sourcebook for the world's greatest roleplaying game!

Explorer's Guide to Wildemount provides everything you need to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons on the continent of Wildemount (set within the world of Exandria)â€”a land of war, betrayal, and swashbuckling adventure.

Comprised of four regions, Wildemount provides endless potential for adventure in a land of brewing conflict and incredible magic. Rising tensions boil over into all-out war between the politically dubious Dwendalian Empire and the light-worshiping wastefolk of Xhorhas, supplying a vibrant backdrop for any D&amp;D campaign to explore.</description>
