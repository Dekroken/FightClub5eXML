  <description>Get ready for the end of a world with the latest innovations from the D&amp;D Game Design Team! This document presents four new subclasses for the Druid (Circle of Preservation), Fighter (Gladiator), Sorcerer (Defiled Sorcery), and Warlock (Sorcerer-King Patron). The material uses the rules in the Player's Handbook.

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
