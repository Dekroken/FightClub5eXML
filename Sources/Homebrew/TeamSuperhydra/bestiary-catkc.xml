    <description>Volcanoes are not-too-seldom used as dumping grounds for all sorts of undesirable objects or materials. Their unfathomable temperatures and churning magma make them ideal for the disposal of just about anything that one doesn't want to see again.

      Sometimes creatures can even be created in this extreme crucible of immeasurable heat and elemental energy. These creatures are born from the elemental heat and amorphous nature of magma, and they take the form of a writhing blob of any number of (now unidentifiable) substances melted in the volcano's caldera. A blob that wanders with intentionâ€”an intention to melt and absorb more material into its mass.
