      <name>Dragonblade</name>
      <text>A human stands atop a towering wall, surveying the battlefield below with piercing eyes. An army of undead advances steadily, marching towards their stronghold with a relentless pace. The human remains calm, a steely determination in his gaze as he descends the stairs, his battle plan already forming in his mind.

An ancient tome, bound in dragon scales, slams shut with a resounding thud. Outside, the gnome's friends call for help, but he only smiles, ready for action−his sixty years of dragon studies have given him the claws and fangs of a draconic predator.

The Arena floor trembles with the chaos of battle as members of the team fall one by one. An elf retreats, his every move watched by his enemies. But his retreat is a ruse, a clever ploy to position himself for the perfect strike. With a dash and flash of his sword, he dispatches the enemy conjurors and charges forward, ready to end the battle and protect his wounded allies.

Masters of draconic power and strategic thinking, these skilled combatants protect Tanares from penumbral cultists and creatures, serving as defenders, monster hunters, and military leaders for the Draconic Council.

The dragonblades are elite combatants with a unique fighting style, harnessing the ancient and mystic powers of dragons. Most of these skilled warriors serve the Draconic Council and take on various roles, such as diplomats, gladiators, and monster hunters, fighting against the corruptive forces that threaten the world.

Dragonblades are highly intelligent fighters, channeling the Draconic Power to perform exceptional feats of swordsmanship. Clad in heavy armor and often wielding shields, these warriors rely on their intellect rather than physical strength to dominate the battlefield. They often act on the frontline of battles, as well as protecting sacred sites, ancient treasures, and the Draconic Council's towers.

Each dragonblade follows a Draconic Soul path, symbolized by a dragon color that bestows upon them elemental powers associated with that dragon. These elemental forces augment their martial prowess, enabling them to combat the sinister otherworldly forces threatening their world. Their cunning also allows them to serve as battle strategists, outwitting enemies and controlling the battlefield with strategic prowess.

As the Malrokian Curse looms over Tanares, threatening to unleash chaos and devastation should large-scale battles erupt, dragonblades are required to avert such conflicts and hunt the cultists and aberrations that strive to cause them. Their missions demand extraordinary courage, tactical expertise, and unwavering dedication to the cause.

In their quest, dragonblades often face formidable adversaries such as the Cult of Shadow Wing, which seeks to corrupt all creatures, including dragons, turning them into penumbral creatures that empower the eldritch Ungods.

As the dragonblades grapple with their daunting tasks, the enigmatic Draconic Council is beset with internal strife, casting shadows over the future of Tanares. The Council's divisions stem from contrasting beliefs regarding the potential of mortals. The majestic Gold Avatar Dragon, Isendden, champions a faction that fervently trusts in mortal potential and destiny. In stark contrast, the formidable Black Avatar Dragon, Zaldrus, spearheads a faction that perceives mortals as feeble and susceptible to corruption. As this clandestine struggle for dominion over the council unfolds, whispers of political intrigue echoes in the Draconic Towers.

Undeterred by these challenges, the dragonblades persevere in their mission. They venture into the Penumbral Plane to free captured dragons, dismantle the Shadow Wing's plans, and vanquish their foes. As the embodiment of strategic combat against the encroaching darkness, the dragonblades unleash their intellect, martial skill, and the awe-inspiring power of dragons to vanquish their foes.

      <name>Dragonblade History</name>
      <text>The dragonblades' origins can be traced back to the Godly Age, when dragons first shared their knowledge and power with mortals. Their original purpose was to increase the strength of mortals in the war against the Ungods' minions and protect Tanares, the world entrusted to the dragons by Tamera and Bauron. As time passed, the Ancient Age saw the creation of the Draconic Council, a powerful assembly of dragons, formed to preserve Tanares from penumbral corruption and the destructive Malrokian Curse.

Upon its formation, the dragonblades became an essential component of the Draconic Council, serving as the backbone of their troops. Most have remained politically neutral, intervening only when the Council acted to prevent war or corruption. From their war-focused beginnings, the dragonblades have evolved into versatile agents, serving on the most diverse arrays of duties within the Council.

During the Kemet Invasion, some dragonblades, recognizing the potential cataclysm, aided in the war effort against the invaders. Among them was the legendary dragonblade Sedura, a solitary warrior trained by a rogue master. Initially manipulated by D.E.A.T.H. to kill the Avatar Dragon Thyra, Sedura redeemed herself by becoming a war hero and helping Talessa and the Draconic Council thwart the Cult of Shadow Wing's attempt to corrupt other Avatar Dragons.

In contemporary times, dragonblades operate as war-counselors and emissaries for various factions, with the Draconic Council allowing this to maintain influence and gather intelligence to prevent wars. Factions remain cautious about the dragonblades' loyalty to the Council, employing them as advisors and military leaders without revealing too much sensitive information.

Facing hordes of sinister creatures, confronting the Shadow Wing, and other malevolent forces, the dragonblades use their unique skills and knowledge to prevent the return of the world-ending Ungods.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>The Draconic Council</name>
      <text>The Draconic Council is the central governing body that oversees the dragonblades and their activities in the world of Tanares. When the gods Tamera and Bauron forged the world of Tanares, they created dragons as its guardians. However, because of mortal's hubris, the Ungods invaded Tanares, instigating conflicts and bringing the dangers of the Penumbral Plane. To protect Tanares from being consumed, the Draconic Council was established, composed of ancient dragons, the wise and powerful Talessa, and elite mortal dragonblades.

The Avatar Dragons, named from their belief of being avatars of the gods' will to protect the world, hold the top positions within the Draconic Council, commanding the fight against the Ungods' minions. The dragonblades, in service to the Council, act as the main agents for the organization, being on the forefront of the battle against forces of the Penumbral Plane.

Selected based on their courage and intellect, dragonblades undergo rigorous training to master martial prowess and unlock mystical abilities. Their most prominent members are given enchanted heavy armor and powerful mystically empowered weapons to serve the Council. Dragonblades act not only as battle-ready warriors but also as peacekeepers and ambassadors, in addition to leading groups to find and destroy the servants of the Ungods.

The Council's primary adversary is the Cult of Shadow Wing, which intends to corrupt dragons and unleash the world-ending Ungods upon Tanares. Dragonblades combat them by foiling their political intrigue, locate and eradicate their cultists, confront penumbral creatures, and recover captured dragons and dragon's eggs.

The Draconic Council is divided into two factions regarding mortals. One faction, led by Isendden and good alligned dragons, advocates cultivation and guidance, recognizing the potential heroism and strength of mortals. The other faction, distrustful of mortals, sees them as susceptible to corruption and advocates for control. This internal struggle shapes the Council's decisions and the missions undertaken by the dragonblades.

Most dragonblades work under the Avatar Dragons as they hold the highest position in the hierarchy of the Council. As the dragonblades contribute to the fight against the Ungods' servants and their penumbral creatures, they may ascend through the Council's ranks, gaining access to better equipment, resources, and more challenging missions. Only the most powerful and dedicated dragonblades can achieve a vote in the Council, joining the esteemed ranks of the two current dragonblade voting members.

The Council's hierarchy is based on merit, with seven ranks representing various roles and responsibilities:

	• Avatar Dragon - Supreme Commanders of the Council (able to vote in council meetings)
	• Draconic Archon - Guardians of the Draconic Towers and Regional Commanders
	• Dragon Lord - Field Generals in charge of large-scale military operations
	• Dragon Commander - Leaders of a battalion (young dragons start here)
	• Dragon Captain - Commanders of a company within a battalion
	• Dragon Lieutenant - Platoon leaders responsible for a group of Soldiers
	• Dragon Soldier - Entry-level rank for mortal members

As they dedicate their efforts to rise in these ranks, the dragonblades stand as a bulwark against darkness, their intellect, combat skills, and raw draconic power crucial to the survival of Tanares. The fate of the world rests on their armored shoulders, and their unwavering dedication to the Draconic Council's mission will be one of the key factors in determining the destiny of dragons and mortals alike.</text>

      <name>D.E.A.T.H. to the Dragons</name>
      <text>In addition to their primary goal of protecting Tanares from the Ungods and their minions, the Draconic Council must also contend with extremist groups like D.E.A.T.H. Founded by individuals who have studied dragons for a long time, D.E.A.T.H. possesses many secrets about dragons, including the supposed plans and goals of some high-ranking members of the Draconic Council. This knowledge not only makes D.E.A.T.H. a dangerous adversary but also attracts those who seek to use this information against the Council.

D.E.A.T.H. members believe that dragons are the source of the dreaded Malrokian Curse, which drives them to eliminate Avatar Dragons and disrupt the workings of the Draconic Council. Their misguided goal to rid Tanares of dragons has led to a long-standing conflict with the Council and its champions, the dragonblades. Unbeknownst to D.E.A.T.H., the Malrokian Curse is not the result of the dragons' existence but rather the machinations of the Ungods, who seek to sow chaos and destruction.

D.E.A.T.H.'s extensive knowledge of dragons' secrets poses a unique challenge to the Council, as various factions may seek to steal or obtain this information for their own purposes. Even virtuous people might try to uncover such secrets to use them to foil the plans of evil dragons. Sometimes, members of the Council themselves may attempt to acquire information obtained by D.E.A.T.H. to use it against their oppositions within the Council, as the two factions led by Isendden and Zaldrus often struggle to agree on the best course of action.

The dragonblades must navigate this complex landscape, dealing with D.E.A.T.H. and its influence on the politics of Tanares, while simultaneously confronting the looming threat of the Shadow Wing and the zealots of D.E.A.T.H. Engaged in a deadly game of deception and intrigue, the heroes of Tanares may find themselves drawn into D.E.A.T.H.'s schemes, lured into missions with unforeseen consequences.

To ensure Tanares' safety and stability, the dragonblades must rely on their cunning and keen minds to deal with the forces of D.E.A.T.H., the machinations of the Shadow Wing, and potential treachery within the Draconic Council itself. Their ability to preserve the world from corruption depends on their unwavering dedication to the cause and their ability to adapt to ever-changing challenges.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>The Draconic Power</name>
      <text>At the core of the dragonblades' legendary prowess lies the enigmatic force known as Draconic Power. This mystical energy, derived from the ancient and enigmatic essence of dragons, elevates them beyond the capabilities of ordinary warriors and spellcasters, transcending the boundaries of normal magic, to grant unique fighting skills.

To harness this formidable power, aspiring dragonblades must undergo rigorous training that melds the disciplines of the scholar, the strategist, and the front-line warrior. In their pursuit of mastery, these elite combatants embrace a curriculum inspired by ancient practices, focusing not only on martial arts but also on intellectual pursuits. They delve into the study of literature, calligraphy, general knowledge, and even the elegant art of poetry, refining their minds and honing their intellects.

This comprehensive education shapes the dragonblades into versatile and adaptive warriors, capable of serving in a variety of roles, from skilled diplomats and cunning strategists to relentless monster hunters and inspiring counselors. Through their training, they acquire profound knowledge of the arcane, as well as the art of tracking and eliminating dangerous penumbral aberrations, which earns them bounties and increases their rank and influence within the Draconic Council.

The journey to become a dragonblade begins with "The Dragon's Trial," a test held by the Council to assess the worthiness of potential recruits based on their intellect, physical abilities, morality, and loyalty to the Council's values. Those who pass the trial receive specialized training in harnessing the mystical force of dragons, perfecting their combat and tactical abilities.

While many dragonblades are trained and serve under the guidance of the Draconic Council, others forge their paths independently or under the tutelage of dragons who have strayed from or never joined the Council. These independent dragonblades are often still recognized for their prowess and may collaborate with the Council on various tasks, working as penumbral monster hunters and collecting bounties.

Despite their immense power and organization, the dragonblades must remain vigilant to ensure their ranks stay pure and uncorrupted. Sinister forces of corruption continually attempt to infiltrate the Draconic Council and subvert dragonblades, siphoning their Draconic Power to strengthen their penumbral dragons. As guardians, the dragonblades are tasked with remaining watchful, identifying corrupted individuals, and resisting the temptation to succumb to their enemies' alluring influence.</text>

      <name>Creating A Dragonblade</name>
      <text>The first step in creating your dragonblade character is to determine whether or not they are affiliated with the Draconic Council. Most dragonblades serve the Council, but there are many wandering dragonblades who could have served as the character's mentor.

If they are affiliated with the Council, work with your Game Master to determine its ranking, who trained it and who is currently its superior, as well as the philosophy and goals of its group inside the Council.

If they are not affiliated with the Council, work with your Game Master to determine the character's mentor, the mentor's history, and why they trained the character.

Finally, decide what led your character to a life of adventure. Were they fulfilling a mission given to them by the Council? Did their studies make them question some of the things taught to them by their master or the Council? Did they encounter a group in need of their leadership that could help them achieve their personal goals? Did they embark on their adventure as part of their training?</text>

        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).

Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared: You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots: You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots:

you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic: If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

When you attack with melee or ranged weapons, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

Starting at 2nd level, when you gain new powers or change one of your powers you must always have at least one power of each different type (claw, scale and wing).

Starting at 8th level, whenever you gain a new level in this class, you can replace one Draconic Power you already know with a different power of a level that you can use.

Additionally, starting at 2nd level, your chosen Draconic Soul will grant special Draconic Powers, according to the list in the Draconic Soul section. They do not count against the number of Draconic Powers you know, and you can't replace them with other Draconic Powers later.

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, whenever you use a Draconic Power, note down its mark, and once you have accumulated all three different marks, your soul becomes empowered.

	• You can spend its empowerment to execute a Draconic Power that requires an action as a bonus action. When doing so, ignore the limitation of using only one Draconic Power per round.

	• After using your Empowered status, you immediately delete all annotated marks and you can begin collecting them anew.

	• You can conserve your Empowered status for a later turn.

	• Every time you roll for initiative at the onset of a battle or finish a short or long rest, all previous marks are erased, and the Empowered status, if not already used, is lost.

Saving Throw and Spell Attack:
Some Draconic Powers require the target to make a saving throw to resist the effects, or you may need to perform a spell attack to hit. The DC for the saving throw and the spell attack is calculated as follows:

Draconic Power DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

        <name>Dragon Form</name>
        <text>Starting at 9th level, you can use your action to magically transform into a dragon form. After the transformation, you can only use this feature again after a long rest.

Your dragonblade level determines the power of the dragon you can transform into, as shown in the Dragon Form table. Your dragon form's aspect matches your Draconic Soul.

Dragon Form:
Dragonblade Level | Dragon Form
9th | Juvenile Dragon Form
12th | Mature Dragon Form
15th | Adult Dragon Form
18th | Old Dragon Form

You can stay in the dragon form for 10 minutes then revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

	• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the dragon form, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the dragon form. If the dragon form has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the dragon form's bonus instead of yours.

	• When you transform, you assume the dragon form's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in dragon form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

	• You can't perform Draconic Powers or cast spells, and your ability to take any action is limited to the capabilities of the dragon form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast.

	• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, species, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.

	• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

On a hit, deal the usual damage and, if the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage and be pushed 20 feet from you in a straight line. If another creature obstructs the path, the movement halts, and that creature takes the same 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

The distance increases to 30 feet and damage to 2d10 at 10th level, then further to 40 feet and 3d10 at 16th level.
