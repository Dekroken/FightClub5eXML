    <text>These unremarkable brass knuckles appear well used if not well loved. They are covered in dings and scratches accompanied by the odd stain.</text>
    <text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can use your reaction to attempt to maim them. When you do, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) or be maimed in one of the following ways of your choice:</text>
    <text>  • Broken Arm. The creature has disadvantage with weapon attack rolls.</text>
    <text>  • Broken Leg. The creature’s walking speed is halved.</text>
    <text>  • Broken Ribs. The creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws.</text>
    <text>  • Broken Skull. Attack rolls against the creature are considered one higher for the purposes of determining whether or not the result is a critical.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>The maimed condition ends on a creature only after they have received medical treatment from a trained professional and rested for one month or they are targeted by a greater restoration spell or similar magic. After you use this ability to attempt to maim a creature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</text>

    <text>Additionally, this club has 5 charges. When you deal damage with this weapon, you can expend one or more charges to attempt to render the creature unconscious. When you do, roll 5d8 (+2d8 for each charge expended beyond the first). If the creature has a number of hit points remaining that is equal to or less than the total of your roll, the creature forgets everything it saw and heard over the last minute and is unconscious for 1 hour or until another person uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.</text>

    <text>You can use an action to blow this unassuming whistle that’s inaudible to all creatures except canines. When you do, you cast the conjure animals spell but can only choose to summon two dire wolves or eight wolves. You do not need to maintain concentration, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Once you do, this magic cannot be used again until dawn of the next day.</text>

    <text>This potion is bright red and smells of peppers and spices. It is typically drizzled on food prior to being consumed but it is possible to consume it straight. A vial of salamander sauce typically has two doses.</text>
    <text>doses to consume. If you consume one dose, you gain resistance to cold damage for 8 hours. If you consume two doses, you gain immunity to cold damage and vulnerability to fire damage for 8 hours. For each dose you consume beyond the first two, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or gain a level of exhaustion.</text>

    <text>This potion must be baked into a biscuit form before its magic can take effect. Its smell is slightly off-putting to humanoids, but is very enticing to beasts. When a beast consumes a biscuit made from this potion, its size increases by one category (from Medium to Large, for example) for 10 minutes. While the beast’s size is increased, it has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws and its weapon attacks deal 1d4 extra damage.</text>
