    <weight>0.5</weight>
    <text>This translucent mushroom dances with internal lights. You can use an action to shake the Luum Shroom, intensifying the light inside. Once activated in this way, the Luum Shroom sheds bright golden light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet for one hour.

      Eating the Luum Shroom instead causes the light to emit from your open mouth for 1d4 hours.</text>

    <weight>0.5</weight>
    <text>Delicate mist swirls beneath the lavender cap of this mushroom. When you eat this magical mushroom, you immediately fall into a trance. While in this trance, there is a 30 percent chance that you see a glimpse of the future, and a 70 percent chance that you have an upsetting hallucination.

      If the character experiences a vision of the future, the player may ask the GM a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The character then experiences a vision of the future concerning this goal, event, or activity by way of response.
      
      If the character experiences a hallucination, the vivid waking nightmare drives the character to be afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see “Madness” in chapter 8 of the DMG). This madness only lasts for 1d6 hours.</text>

    <detail>very rare flora, color-shifting mushroom</detail>
    <weight>0.5</weight>
    <text>This magical mushroom's color shifts between a silvery gray and a golden amber when viewed from different angles. When you eat this mushroom, your pupils dilate to a near-impossible size. For 1d4 hours you see the world around you as it truly is, as if under the effects of a True Seeing spell.

      Viewing the world through this lens can be a jarring experience, especially for first timers. For every hour that a character remains under the effects of the Wide-Eyed Shroom, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom Saving throw. At the end of the duration, a character who failed any of their saving throws is afflicted by a short-term madness (see “Madness” in chapter 8 of the DMG).</text>

    <text>This thin yellow and black mushroom trembles with energy. When you eat a Zoom Shroom, your body begins to vibrate and the world around you appears to slow. Your speed is doubled, you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll for the next 1 minute.</text>
