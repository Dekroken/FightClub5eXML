    <text>This golden badge is usually given to wizards who either excel at or who have mastered abjuration magic as a symbol of their accomplishments. While wearing this badge, you always have the shield spell prepared if you know it, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared. In addition, whenever you cast the shield spell, you can take another reaction before the start of your next turn. This second reaction can't be used to cast the shield spell again.

    <text>This ammunition is covered in an alchemical concoction that ignites upon impact, casting bright light in the space of the target it hits and dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute. A creature struck by the ammunition takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes while the ammunition remains lit. The ammunition remains lodged in a target it hits until a creature uses an action to remove and snuff out the ammunition. If the target is invisible, it's revealed while the ammunition is lodged within it. The ammunition is destroyed by the lit solution, preventing it from being recovered once fired.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

    <text>This shield emits a faint, holy glow when wielded and recognizes your devotion to a higher power. When you attune to this shield, the emblem adorning its face changes to one that represents your chosen deity, allowing you to use the shield as a holy symbol. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

While wielding the shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to shatter into countless fragments of pure light. The pieces of light protect you as if you were wielding the shield, leaving your hands free. The light surrounds you for 1 minute, until you dismiss the effect as a bonus action, or until you fall unconscious or die, at which point the shield rematerializes on the ground at your feet or into your hand if you have one free. If your holy symbol is emblazoned or attached to the shield, it floats prominently amidst the shards of light and continues to function as a spellcasting focus. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you're surrounded by the light in this way. The surrounding shards of light cast bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

    <text>This spiraling pendant is made of three magic-sensitive panes of colorful crystal. Each piece of crystal is attuned to a different arcane element. If you can cast spells, you can use the amulet as a spellcasting focus while you're attuned to it.

The amulet has 4 charges and regains 2 expended charges daily at dawn. When you deal cold, fire, or lightning damage to a single creature while wearing the amulet, you can expend any number of its charges to reroll that many of the cold, fire, or lightning damage dice. You must use the new rolls.

Whenever you take cold, fire, or lightning damage from a hostile creature, the amulet regains 1 charge.

    <text>This mirror-like shield is enchanted with abjuration magic that can reflect spells back at their source. While holding the shield, you can use it as a reaction when hit by an attack to cast the shield spell from it. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

The shield has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you succeed on a saving throw to resist the effects of a spell that targets only you or are missed by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to learn the level of the spell. As part of your reaction, you can expend a number of the shield's charges equal to the level of the spell (up to 6th level) to reflect that spell back at its source. You can't reflect a spell of 7th level or higher. When you reflect a spell in this way, the caster of the spell must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 radiant damage for each expended charge as a bolt of reflected arcane energy hits them. On a successful save, the damage is halved. If you reflect a spell in this way that would cause you to take half damage on a successful save, you take no damage instead.

    <text>When you attune to this quarterstaff, it remains solid in your grip but feels pliable within your mind. You can choose to use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with this weapon instead of Strength. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

When you make an attack with this magic weapon, you can choose to make the attack at range. When you do, you use your mind to telekinetically curve the quarterstaff into the form of a longbow. The bow is magically strung with an arcane energy that arcs between the rings on either end of the weapon. A glowing, magical arrow is formed whenever the arcing energy is drawn back. The arrow disappears after it hits a target. When you make a ranged attack with the quarterstaff in this way, the weapon is treated as if it were a magical longbow. This longbow can only use the ammunition that it generates and does not have the heavy property. While holding this weapon, you're proficient with this long bow when using it in this way.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

In addition, this quarterstaff has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the At tack action with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the magic missile spell from the quarterstaff as a bonus action, instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the missiles are fired from either the bow or the quarterstaff's embossed faces.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

In addition, if you hit a magically created object or structure, such as a wall of ice, with the war pick, you can choose to dispel the wall or object as if by the dispel magic spell (6th-level version).

    <text>An astral bracelet is a powerful magical bangle that allows its wearer to see, commune, or otherwise manifest things using powers beyond the Material Plane. The metal and glyphs of each bracelet are related to the kind of power that it holds. You can pull the bracelet off and hold it in the palm of your hand as an action. When you do, the bracelet unfurls to reveal the four inner rings collapsed within it, transforming the bracelet into an astronomical sphere. While the bracelet is transformed into the astronomical sphere, its inner rings slowly spin on their own.

The bracelet has 10 charges and regains 2d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the sphere's last charge, its spinning rings magically fold up again into the wearable bracelet. You can fold the rings back into place early using an action.

Spells:
Each kind of astral bracelet has a different list of spells that can be cast from it. If a spell cast in this way normally requires a component worth at least 100 gp, that component is still required when casting the spell. While holding the sphere, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC:

	• dispel magic (3 charges)
	• floating disk (1 charge)
	• globe of invulnerability (6 charges)
	• hallucinatory terrain (4 charges)
	• hypnotic pattern (3 charges)
	• protection from energy (3 charges)

    <text>This golden war pick was forged in the depths of the Astral Plane and leaves a faint trail of extraplanar energy behind it when swung. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and targets hit by it take an extra 1d4 force damage from the attack. In addition, while you're in the Astral Plane, you always know the direction of the nearest portal to another plane of existence.

Portal:
This weapon has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of its charges to slam the war pick into any flat, solid surface at least 5 feet across in any direction. When you do, you create a small planar rift. The rift fades after 1 minute. If you expend another charge in this way while there's a rift within 300 feet of you, the two rifts tear open to form a por tal between them. The portal lasts until the end of your next turn or until you close it early (no action required). When the portal closes, the rifts fade. Medium and smaller creatures and objects can travel or interact freely through the portal while it's open, carrying with them any momentum they had through to the other side.

Both rifts must be placed on the same plane of existence, and if you create a second rift more than 300 feet away from the first, the first one fades. Rifts can be entered from any direction to travel through a portal. When you enter a rift in this way, you reappear 5 feet in front of the other rift.

In addition, you can expend 1 of the war pick's charges when you hit a Small or larger creature with it. When you do, that creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage as a rift appears on its body. Rifts that appear on a creature in this way are attached to the creature and move with it until a portal is

opened. When a portal opens between two rifts and at least one of the rifts is attached to a creature, the attached creature or creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be immediately shunted through the portal to the other rift's location. Large and larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

    <text>This gold and silver set of daggers seem ordinary when used on their own, but become magical when used together. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these daggers while you hold one of them in each hand. When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these daggers, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

In addition, if you hit the same target with both daggers in the same round, it takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage from the second attack and can't use its reaction until the end of your turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>This magic handaxe is made from the remains of a slain axe beak. The first time you hit a creature that has a flying speed on each of your turns with this axe, that creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Each time that a creature fails this saving throw, that creature's flying speed is reduced by 15 feet for 1 minute.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

    <text>This small, colorful bag is filled with 1d6 + 4 golden, marble-like orbs called sundrops that glow softly when held. As an action, you can throw a sundrop at a point or object you can see within 30 feet. When you do, the orb explodes into a dazzling pillar of light that lasts until the start of your next turn. The pillar is a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light centered on the point where the sundrop shattered. The light is sunlight.

A dispel magic spell targeting the light ends the effect early.

    <text>This unassuming platinum ring is polished to a mirror finish. When you reduce a Small or larger hostile creature to 0 hit points while wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to absorb a portion of that creature's essence into the ring. Looking into the ring shows the reflection of the creature whose essence is held inside. As an action, you can release the captured essence and assume either the creature's appearance or one of its features.

If you take on the appearance of the creature, it must be a creature no more than one size larger or smaller than you. You do not physically change in size or shape, but your body is shrouded in a convincing illusion. Your voice changes to match the creature's, and you can understand any of its known languages but can neither read nor speak any that you don't already know. Another creature can see through the illusion by succeeding on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Physical interaction with this illusory form reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. The illusion lasts for 8 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action or fall unconscious.

If you assume one of the creature's features, your body or mind temporarily changes to accommodate the new ability. You can choose to gain 1 skill or saving throw proficiency, damage resistance, condition immunity, sense, or language that the creature had. If the creature could breathe underwater, you can choose to gain that feature instead. You retain this feature for 8 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action or fall unconscious.

Once you capture an essence with the ring, you can't do so again for 1d8 hours. You can only have 1 essence at a time. If you capture an essence when you already have one, you replace the original.

    <text>This small music box can play songs at the request of the holder. As a bonus action, you can command the box to play a song for which it has music, causing the contraption to emit a slightly tinny rendition of the musical number. The box can know up to 5 songs at a time but can't recreate lyrics or other creature sounds. The box has a knob on its side to adjust its volume: able to be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream.

Sheet music can be fed into the box through a narrow slot along the bottom of the device. Sheet music must be labeled with a song title, page number, and instrument in order to be replayed. Pages failing to meet the requirements cause the box to make a sad, discordant noise before being spat back out. Once a sheet is successfully fed into the box, it is consumed and can't be retrieved. If a new piece of music causes the box to forget an older one, it quickly plays several bars of the now-forgotten number before it slows to a stop.

    <text>While holding this sturdy iron shield, you can use an action to plant it on the ground and expand its height and width to stretch up to 15 feet across in either direction, potentially becoming a defensive wall or similar platform. The edges of the shield magically conform to fit the shape of an enclosed space, such as the walls of a tunnel or hallway. While holding the expanded shield in place, your speed becomes 0 and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Regardless of the shield's size, its weight always remains the same.

The expanded shield is considered a nonmagical structure that has AC 14 and 40 hit points. The shield can remain expanded for up to 1 minute before it reverts back to its normal size. The expanded shield reverts early (but is not destroyed) if it reaches 0 hit points or moves. If you're holding the expanded shield, you can choose to revert it early using a bonus action.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

As an action, you can touch one of the runes and say the command phrase, "I can do this," to gain proficiency in the rune's associated tool for the next 24 hours. The rune glows with arcane energy while in effect. Once a rune is activated in this way, it can't be activated again until 1d4 days have passed.

There are 10 runes on the bangle that can be activated in this way: alchemist's supplies, carpenter's tools, cook's utensils, leatherworker's tools, smith's tools, tinker's tools, instruments (drum, flute, lute, lyre), navigator's tools, thieves' tools, and vehicles (water). If you're already proficient with any of these tools, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the tool while the rune is active.

In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

    <text>While holding this segmented, 1-foot-long rod, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to extend in either direction. The rod can extend up to 50 feet or as far as the surrounding space allows. If the rod touches another creature or surface before reaching its full length, the rod stops moving in that direction. If it stops moving against a solid, unmoving surface, the rod fills the gaps to hold firm against it.

The rod is unwieldy to hold once it's longer than 10 feet, forcing you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to maintain your grip on it while it's extended beyond that range. The DC for this check is equal to 8 + 1 for every 5 feet beyond 10 that the rod is extended. For example, the DC is 9 while the rod is 15 feet long, but 16 while a full 50 feet. If you lose your grip and drop the rod or use it to make an attack while it's extended more than 10 feet, it immediately retracts back to its shortened length. You can speak the rod's command word again as an action to cause it to retract.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against a Small or larger hostile creature, you magically earn a number of gold coins equal to the attack's damage. When you do, the axe glimmers like a sparkling coin, and you can sense the weight and clink of coins magically falling into your purse, pocket, or bag (your choice). If you have no room for the coins or don't want them to be immediately added to your storage, the coins erupt from the wound you inflict on the target instead. Once the axe generates coins in this way, it can't create any more for 12 hours.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

A creature can use its action to remove or reattach the handle of the maul to the keg, and another action to pour out or stopper it.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While held in combat, the hammer heats the liquor inside it. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 acid damage as the hammer buckles from the impact and releases a spray of the volatile liquor.

For 1 minute after a target has been sprayed with acid in this way, the next time that target takes fire damage, it takes an extra 2d6 fire damage as the liquor ignites.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this bow, the bow creates a thin barrier of protective magic that stays between you and that creature until the start of your next turn. If you hit a different creature while protected by this barrier, the barrier moves to defend you against the new target instead. While the barrier is protecting you against a creature in this way, you're considered to have half cover against that creature's ranged attacks and spell effects.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, longbow

    <text>This glass sphere contains a raging blizzard inside. It's cold to the touch and vibrates with the gusts of wind trapped within. As an action, you can throw the orb at a point or object you can see within 30 feet, shattering it on impact. When the orb shatters, the blizzard erupts from the glass in a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling ice and snow centered on the point of impact. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is unaffected.

The blizzard remains for 1d4 rounds or until targeted by a dispel magic spell (DC 15 or cast at 5th level or higher). Any surface within the area is covered in a slick sheet of ice and sleet, turning the ground within the sphere into difficult terrain that remains for the effect's duration. While the blizzard persists, the area is heavily obscured.

    <text>These iron pendants come in pairs and are connected by a powerful bond of self-sacrifice. In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature with whom you are close perform a brief, 1-minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice and reduce your total maximum hit points by (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures' blood are absorbed into the normally clear gems adorning the faces of these pendants. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.

While the bound creatures are wearing their respective pendants and are on the same plane of existence, they're protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, it's immediately revived with 2d10 hit points plus twice the number of hit points it had sacrificed. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked unconscious, ending the blood pact and restoring both creatures' hit point maximums to normal. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical.

    <text>This roughly hewn obsidian dagger is razor sharp and can be used as a spellcasting focus. Its handle is covered in small holes that drink in whatever blood runs down the blade. There's a small reservoir for blood at the dagger's pommel that seems to never completely fill. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The dagger has 5 charges and regains 1d3 + 2 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus against a living creature you can see within 5 feet of you. When you do, an illusory crimson dagger sweeps out towards the creature. A creature hit by this attack takes necrotic damage equal to 3d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If the target is a construct, plant, or undead creature, you don't regain any hit points in this way.

Alternatively, while holding the dagger, you can expend 1 or more of its charges when you cast a spell using a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell slot. The spell must target either a single creature or yourself. The spell slot you use to cast this spell counts as one level higher for each charge you expend in this way. You can't increase a spell slot level beyond 5th level in this way. When you use this property of the dagger, you also expend 1 Hit Die for each charge you expend in this way. Roll a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of expended charges and take necrotic damage equal to the total you roll. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. If expending charges in this way causes you to fall to 0 hit points, the spell fails and you fall unconscious.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>These red goggles have a second set of lenses that magically adjust their distance from your eyes to magnify and focus on targets. While you're attuned to these goggles, you are unaffected by visual obscurity such as fog or smoke and can see up to 60 feet in magical and nonmagical darkness. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet. Additionally, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

These lenses are also imbued with several innate spells. While wearing the goggles, you can cast the following spells from them, using your spell save DC, but can only target creatures whose blood you can see: hunter's mark (3rd-level version), locate creature, or scrying. Casting a spell in this way does not require you to concentrate on the spell in order to maintain it. Once the oculus casts a spell in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

    <text>This heavy crossbow is made of metal and fires small bolts of electricity instead of normal ammunition. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you pull the string back to load the crossbow, the string crackles with energy and loads a small bolt of lightning ammunition instead. Attacks made with this cross bow deal 1d12 lightning damage instead of 1d10 piercing. In addition, whenever you make a ranged attack with this weapon against a metal target or a creature wearing metal armor, you make the attack with advantage.

This crossbow acts as a small lightning rod. If another creature within 10 feet of you takes lightning damage while you're holding the crossbow, you take 1d6 lightning damage for every 10 lightning damage the other creature took.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

    <text>These dark, fleshy boots grant marvelous powers and enhance your normal movement. While wearing these boots, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can hover up to 20 feet off the ground in this way, leaving behind a thin trail of shadow when you do. In addition, when you take the Dash action while wearing the boots, you can move an extra 10 feet.

 The boots have 4 charges and regain 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the boots, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of their charges to cast either the expeditious retreat or misty step spell from them. When you cast misty step in this way, the normally silver mist that surrounds you is dark and ominous.

Curse:
When you pull these boots over your feet for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the boots before they extend it to you. On a failure, the boots' muscly sinews dig into your legs and feet, interlocking with your own flesh. You immediately take 4d8 necrotic damage as the tainted muscles and flesh latch onto you, and you can't remove the boots unless you're targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While you wear the boots, your feet sometimes move in unexpected ways. You make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage, and it costs you an extra 10 feet of movement to stand up after you fall prone.

If you fail the saving throw to resist the curse and later remove the boots, you take another 4d8 necrotic damage as they painfully tear themselves from your body.

When you make a mid-air jump, faint clouds fly out from under your feet. The boots allow you to jump in this way once before they need to make contact with a solid surface again. Jumping in this way while falling before landing on solid ground prevents up to 20 feet of fall damage.

When an affected creature attempts to rest, their dreams are plagued with terrible nightmares, preventing them from benefiting from a long rest. The creature can reattempt the saving throw once every 24 hours.

The poison lasts until the affected creature succeeds on a saving throw or is cured by the greater restoration, heal, or wish spell.

When you hit a target with a melee attack using the weapon, you can press a button on the handle as a bonus action to deploy the spring-loaded net. When you do, the target of the attack is restrained if it's Large or smaller. Once the net is deployed, you can retract and reset it as an action. When you do, anything held by the net is released. Attacks with the spear are made with disadvantage while the net is deployed. If something is restrained by the net, you can't use the spear to make weapon attacks.

You can use a bonus action to prime the net to trigger upon impact, allowing it to deploy when the spear hits a tar get the next time it's thrown or swung as part of an attack.

This net follows the net's normal rules but cannot be detached from the spear without destroying the net. You can replace the net with a new one by spending 1 minute attaching it to the spear.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.
