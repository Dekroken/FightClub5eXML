      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You don't belong in this world. You come from an alien realm where magic doesn't exist, technology is far more advanced, and the adventures you now face are confined only to fiction. You don't know how you were transported to this world or why you were brought here, but you are trying to make the best of a perplexing situation.

Consider how long you have been here, and how you have managed to procure the powers associated with your class since arriving. Have you been stuck here for years, learning the art of some class as a way to survive? Did you appear not only in an unfamiliar place but also in an unfamiliar body, maybe of some inhuman race that doesn't exist in your own world, which comes with instinctual powers and talents that you're still learning to command? Also think about your previous life, what skills it would have taught you and how those now apply to your new life.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Any two skills that are not Arcana, History, or Religion
	• Tool Proficiencies: Two of your choice from the following: any artisan's tools besides alchemist's supplies, any musical instrument, any gaming set
	• Equipment: A mobile phone with 0% battery, a wallet with dozen banknotes of a currency not accepted in this world, a ring of keys, set of strange clothes, and a pouch of 10 gp

      <name>Feature: Modern Knowledge</name>
      <text>While you came into this unfamiliar world without a copper piece to your name, the advanced knowledge you brought with you has given you something of value to offer. You are well versed in a field that is farther advanced in your original world than the world you are in now. It could be medicine, mathematics, engineering, a craft, or anything else that makes sense for your character.

In order to secure a life for yourself, you contributed this knowledge to some organization that it was relevant to. For example, you might have taught a university the secrets of calculus, or instructed a blacksmith's guild in how to make stronger steel. The organization considers themselves indebted to you for your contribution, and are willing to support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. They consider you a member of their organization, although you may have to pay monthly dues to gain the full benefits of membership.

The technology you introduced may cause a disruption in the world and its balance of power. Discuss with your DM what impact your knowledge has on the world now that it has been introduced, if any.</text>

      <name>Variant Feature: I've read the handbook!</name>
      <text>Because displaced characters are implied to have come from modern day Earth, there is a chance that they may have played Dungeons and Dragons as a game. This could potentially give an excuse for the character to know things about game mechanics and monsters that would otherwise seem like metagaming. Make sure your DM is comfortable with your character having this sort of knowledge in-game before characterizing them that way.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Displaced characters are strangers in a strange land, stuck in a place where everything they thought was fictional is now real. They might see this as a call to action to become a protagonist like in all the stories they grew up with, or they may only care about making it out of these adventures alive. Either way, they are defined by a culture that those around them can't come close to relating to.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Scientists are people that believe discovery and invention are vital to progress, and seek knowledge about the world in which they live. You are one of these people... but you take things a bit too far. To most people, your ideas are crazy: unnecessary at best, and reprehensible at worst. Because of this, you're shunned by your community, though whether your "madness" is legitimate or just a label slapped on you by people who don't understand is up to you. 

You will want to discuss the reason(s) you left your home with your Dungeon Master. Did people harass you, or ignore you altogether? Were you run out of town for your bizarre experiments, or did you take your leave to try to find like-minded people? Are you searching for something obscure, or do you simply wish for freedom to study what and how you please?

	• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, and Medicine
	• Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from Alchemist's Supplies, Brewer's Supplies, Carpenter's Tools, Cook's Utensils, Mason's Tools, Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, Herbalism Kit, and Poisoner's Kit
	• Equipment: A set of common clothes, two sets of tools you are proficient with, a book on your field of study, an abacus, a piece of chalk, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Though they may have much in common, these are not the types of scholars that fill the halls of universities. They are radical free thinkers who are defined by ostracization. Greater society dismisses their ideas and goals as anything from foolish to evil, leaving them to work in their makeshift laboratories alone, for hours, days, or weeks at a time. They're obsessed. They're dedicated. Their ideas are strange — but rest assured, no two are the same.

2 | I am dismissive of magic.

6 | I'm lost in my thoughts more often than not.
7 | I always think there's room for improvement.
8 | I care about what people think much more than I let on.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Knowledge. I need to learn everything I can, even if others don't understand. (Neutral)
2 | Progress. I want the world to move forward, towards being a better place. (Good)
3 | Power. What I learn will help me rule over those who doubted me. (Evil)
4 | Freedom. Discovery and invention should not be restricted. (Chaotic)
5 | Method. There is a right way to do things. (Lawful)
6 | Legacy. I want to be remembered when I depart this plane. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | My work is of the utmost importance. I can't let how others see me get in the way.
2 | I'm working toward one specific discovery that will change everything.
3 | I will protect my journals at any cost.

      <name>Feature: Taste Analysis</name>
      <text>You've tasted many different cuisines in your travels, and have developed a knack for flavor recognition. You have the ability to determine exactly what non-magical ingredients were used in any food you taste, and can recreate an almost identical meal when given the right ingredients.

If these are ingredients you're very familiar with (such as ingredients from your homeland or meals you prepare often), then you can even make a meal that exceeds the original in terms of flavor and quality.</text>
