        <text>Music is a powerful thing. It can bolster a burning passion, inspire the meek to bravery, and sooth a cluttered mind. Wandering bards have mastered the art of creating music to shape and manipulate the thoughts and hearts of the world through song, words, and instrument. However, it is the Maestro who has learned to evoke music from the natural world around them and weave these notes with arcane skill into melodies of dynamic and potent magic.

With but a raised hand or wand, a Maestro listens for the clang of arms on armor, the heavy footfalls of a giant, the crackle of a bolt of lightning, and catches them, crafting them into a symphony of rousing musical movements. They conduct the sounds of the battlefield like a phantom orchestra, empowering the blows of their allies, altering the minds and moods of their opponents, and changing the pace of the fray in their favor.

The College of the Maestro calls to those who enjoy enabling their companions to become even more adept, working in unison with your sonata. It refines those of raw talent into majestic performers who can pluck the thoughts from a mind like a musical note, amplify the fears of lesser beings through sourceless, ominous tones, and seemingly stretch time by commanding the tempo of a heartbeat. Maestros become heroes who can take the chaos of the world and carve it as they see fit by controlling the vibrations of music that subtly guide the realm.

    <prerequisite>4th Level, Initiate of High Sorcery (Nuitari) Feat</prerequisite>
    <text>You have spent some time in the bardic teachings of a maestro, granting you minor command over the music of combat. You gain the following benefits.

• You learn 2 conducting techniques of your choice from among those available to the College of the Maestro in the bard class (See the "Conducting Techniques" spell list). If a technique you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

• If you already have Bardic Inspiration dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6. This die can be given to others as a bonus action (per the bard feature, Bardic Inspiration), or can be used to fuel your techniques. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when you use it. You regain this expended bardic inspiration die when you finish a short or long rest.
