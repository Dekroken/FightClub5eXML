        <name>Otherwordly Patron: The Creeping Vine (HB)</name>
        <text>Your patron is a magical plant, a powerful primal spirit, or some other grand entity of nature and growth, such as a powerful treant, an ancient green dragon, a Totoro, or an archdryad. This being might seek to expand itself and its influence through seed or spore, or it might want to simply perpetuate, accelerate, or otherwise enable the natural cycles of life. In the Forgotten Realms, such beings include the Great Oak of Kuldahar and Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi. In the world of Ebberon, the daelkyr Avassh might be your patron, and in the world of Ravnica, the Selesnya Conclave might be the source of your powers.

        <name>The Creeping Vine (HB): Biome</name>
        <text>You gain one of the following features, based on a biome of your choice.

Arid:
You retain scarce resources like a cactus retains water. When you expend a Pact Magic spell slot on a spell that targets only one creature, and that spell has no effect on the target, you regain the spell slot.

Boreal:
Like a pine tree in the taiga, you can enter a state of hibernation. As an action, you can turn yourself and your equipment to solid wood. You are petrified in a special way. You have all the traits of the petrified condition, except you remain conscious of your surroundings, you can perceive through your senses as normal, and your weight remains the same. You float in water, you are inflammable, and you do not need to eat, breathe, drink, or sleep. You cannot benefit from short or long rests while in this form. You can exit this state at any time (no action required), but no sooner than 1 hour after entering it. Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Jungle:
You can entangle and ensnare your foes in creepers and vines. You learn the thorn whip cantrip. It counts as a warlock spell for you but doesn't count against the number of cantrips you can know. When you cast it, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Otherwordly Patron: The Inevitable (HB)</name>
        <text>the inevitable  the inevitable  You have forged a contract with an inevitable, an axiomatic being from one of the planes of law set to uphold and enforce order across the multiverse. Whether you sought these powers purposely, misunderstood an agreement you were making, or now serve as punishment for breaching a contract, your patron's powers allow you to impose law and order, sidestepping fate and luck instead for the blessing of definite results.

Perhaps you forged a contract in the Halls of Concordance. If so, your patron may be a quarut, marut, or kolyarut of Mechanus. In the world of Ravnica, a high ranking member of the Azorius Senate might act as your patron, or your powers might come from the Guild Pact itself.

Your contract may require you to assist in establishing order in various ways. You can choose a directive, allow your DM to choose one, or determine one randomly, using the Inevitable Directive table.

Inevitable Directive:
1d6 | Directive
1 | To hunt fugitives of the law and those who try to escape punishment.
2 | To write, deliver, or witness the signing of minor contracts.
3 | To apprehend those who break interplanar contracts.
4 | To enforce the laws of life and death, hunting those who would deny the grave or otherwise disrupt the flow of souls into the afterlife.
5 | To maintain the laws of space and time, investigating permanent portals between planes or temporal disruptions and disorder.
6 | To support the divine order and help stop those who seek to destroy or become gods.

Your Contract:
To an inevitable, the spirit of an agreement is nothing, and the letter of the law is everything. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your contract, how it might be enforced, what directive best suits your campaign, how closely you might be monitored, and what the consequences might be for breaking it. Breaking your contract, however, shouldn't mean an immediate end for your character. Instead, it should create interesting and meaningful complications.  For example, if you serve a marut hunting someone who broke an extraplanar contract, your patron may suddenly appear to drag you back to the Halls for judgement should you be discovered aiding your quarry or allowing it to escape justice. As punishment, you might temporarily lose access to one or more of your warlock class features, or be assigned a proctor to observe you more carefully, such as a modron for a familiar.

Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

On a success, you are revived with 1 hit point. If your head or heart is missing, the check automatically fails. Any other missing body parts slowly regrow over the course of 7 days. If you are missing any vital body parts besides your heart and head (e.g. your blood), the magic of everlasting life sustains you while they regrow. Once you have been revived in this way, you can't be so again for 7 days.

        <name>Otherworldy Patron: The Ancient Wyrm (HB)</name>
        <text>It has been your privilege to make a pact with an ancient dragon of untold power. They reside elsewhere--on an Elemental Plane, in the Elemental Chaos, or in a demiplane of their own creation, for example--but you are their emissary and agent on the Material Plane. Your patron has charged you with furthering their agenda, which generally amounts to glorifying their name, spreading respect for dragonkind, and gathering wealth on their behalf. In exchange for your loyalty and regular tribute, your patron grants you a sliver of their magical influence and prowess.

As dragons are ambitious creatures, and only grow more so as they age, your patron is virtually guaranteed to have one or more rivals of comparable might. They might seek to outdo or embarrass each other, or eliminate each other's forces in a centuries-long game of cat-and-mouse. Whatever their intrigues may be, you are a crucial part of them, though the details may be kept from you.

Notable dragons that you may have the pleasure to serve include the gold dragon Lareth, the King of Justice; the red dragon Balagos, the Flying Flame; and the silver dragon Mithbarakaz, the Mithral Shield.

To summon the draconic avatar, you must spend a warlock spell slot. It acts on its own initiative count and obeys your commands (no action required by you). You can communicate with it telepathically as long as it is within 60 feet of you. It disappears after 1 minute, if you or it are reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it early as an action.

Some are simply bored, and will often bestow great boons or terrible curses upon those who succeed or fail their riddles.

Beings that forge such pacts with mortals might include sphinxes, mummy lords, nagas or even powerful spellcasters on the cusp of godhood.

        <name>The Cryptic Oracle (HB): Rule of Three</name>
        <text>You can deliver riddles with your patron's power to aid your allies or confound your foes. As a bonus action, choose a creature other than you that is within 60 feet of you. If the creature can hear and understand you, it must make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC to attempt to solve the riddle.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can choose to grant it a boon, which the creature can spend to gain advantage on one type of roll of your choice:
an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, you can either grant yourself the boon, or cause the creature to suffer a curse in the form of disadvantage on its next roll of the chosen type. The boon or curse fades when the roll is made, or when the recipient finishes a long rest.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it whenever you finish a long rest. Each time you use it, you must choose a different type of roll.

        <text>You can discover secrets by getting into places few others can.

As an action, you can teleport to a space within 30 feet of you. You travel the distance in a form of your choosing, perhaps as a fine stream of sand, snow, or glowing runes. You don't need to see your destination, provided there is a path to it (at least 1 inch wide) within 30 feet of you. If the targeted space is occupied, the action fails, but your use of the feature isn't expended.

        <name>The Cryptic Oracle (HB): Riddle for the Ages</name>
        <text>You can force your enemies into a contest of wits with your patron.

As an action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you. That creature is teleported across time and space to your patron's domain, where it must answer three perplexing riddles. While before your patron, the creature is incapacitated.

At the start of its next turn, the creature must make three consecutive Intelligence saving throws against your warlock spell save DC. If the creature fails any of its saving throws, it is hurled through time and space, either into the past or future of a plane of your patron's choice and according to its whims. For each failed save, the creature takes 3d10 psychic damage and ages by 1 year, but its statistics otherwise remain the same.

At the end of the creature's turn, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

        <name>Otherworldy Patron: The Great Ooze (HB)</name>
        <text>Your patron is an ancient and powerful ooze. Unlike the average ooze, whose existence is driven by mindless consumption, your ancient patron has developed powerful psychic abilities and has bestowed the traits of their unusual form upon your body. Often these entities will sow their yearning for destruction within you, compelling you to seep your way into the world on their behalf.

Beings of this type might include one of the original offspring of the demon lord Juiblex or a denizen of the Swamp of Oblivion the para-elemental plane of ooze. In Eberron, Kyrzin the Daelkyr is one such being. It could also be an ooze from a time before even the gods - primordial leftovers from the soup of creation.
