        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Mundanity (HB)</name>
        <text>There are those who study the arcane as a means to change the world around them. There is a certain arrogance in that concept, so in order to maintain balance there exists a group dedicated to preservation of the natural and the mundane. Monks who follow the Way of Mundanity use both the study of magic and the mastery of their own internal energies to battle those who use the arcane.

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Iron Grasp (HB)</name>
        <text>Balance is lost when one disrupts the livelihood of another. Monks of the Way of the Iron Grasp are taught to establish safety and order within their sphere of influence, training relentlessly in martial techniques to pin down foes and protect allies. Many of this tradition wear gauntlets that they forge themselves as a symbol of their dedication and ideals.

Monasteries that teach this tradition often act as militias for nearby settlements or as a council that oversees and rules adjacent villages and towns. The heads of these monasteries offer respect towards even the lowest of peasants, but have no tolerance for troublemakers. Still, they risk life and limb to hold the peace when external threats arise, regardless of who needs protection.

        <name>Way of the Iron Grasp (HB): Iron Grasp Technique</name>
        <text>You can disrupt the flow of ki in another creature's body with grappling techniques that prevent it from moving and harming allies. You master special martial arts techniques used to disable opponents and safeguard allies. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows and that creature is no more than one size category larger than you, you can force the creature to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) against your ki save DC. On a failed save, the target is grappled by you. You must use a free hand for the grapple as normal.

While grappled in this way, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you. If the creature uses its action to try to escape the grapple, it makes its ability check against your ki save DC. When it does so, you can expend 1 ki point as a reaction to impose disadvantage on its ability check.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements Remastered (HB)</name>
        <text>This Remastered subclass aims to bring the Four Elements subclass up to the precedent set by the other Player's Handbook monk subclasses in the following ways:

	• It recalculates the ki cost of spells and other abilities.

	• It restructures the Disciple of the Elements feature. Now, as an elemental master, you know all Elemental Disciplines, but can only prepare 2-5 each day, depending on your level in this class.

	• It gives you access to elemental cantrips. You learn one elemental control cantrip and one damaging elemental cantrip. Full casters, masters of magic, learn additional cantrips at 6th and 11th levels. As an elemental master, you also learn additional cantrips at those levels.

	• It provides new Elemental Discipline options. Some of these provide access to suitable spells from the Player's Handbook, Elemental Evil Player's Companion, or Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Others offer passive ability options or other creative options from our design team. including passive ability options that have unlimited uses.

        <text>You can speak, read, and write Primordial, and you know magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. Most disciplines require you to spend ki points each time you use it.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can prepare two Elemental Disciplines of your choice, all of which are detailed in the "Elemental Disciplines" section below. If an Elemental Discipline has prerequisites, you must meet them to prepare it. A level prerequisite refers to your monk level. You can prepare one additional Elemental Discipline at a time at 6th, 11th, and 17th levels.

        <name>Way of the Four Elements Remastered (HB): Casting Elemental Spells</name>
        <text>Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

Spells and Ki Points:
Monk Levels | Maximum Ki Points for a Spell
5th-8th | 3
9th-16th | 4

Fangs of the Fire Snake:
When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet.

On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.

Citizen of the Elements:
Prerequistite: 6th level

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Devils (HB)</name>
        <text>Monks of the Way of Devils are part of an ancient and unholy order, one dedicated to serving the legions of devils in their war against the demons of the abyss, as well as serving their infernal masters' interests on the Material Plane. Whereas most monks train in the art of self-defense, those of the Way of Devils focus on inflicting punishment and controlling their enemies. It is said that the first of these monks were Duergar, newly bound into pacts with Asmodeus and willing to wield his devilish chains over the prospect of becoming chained themselves.

        <name>Way of Devils (HB): Devilish Chain</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to summon a spectral, fiendish chain of burning iron to attack and bind your foes. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can summon the chain to your empty hand and use it for the attack. The chain uses the statistics of a whip, but with a reach of 15 feet, and it counts as a monk weapon for you. You can only have one chain summoned at a time. It disappears after 1 minute, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it early as a bonus action.

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with your chain, you can spend 1 ki point to apply one of the following effects. You can only use one of these effects each time you make an attack with the chain.

Binding Chain:
The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained until the start of your next turn and cannot move more than 15 feet away from you. A creature restrained by the chain can use its action to make a Strength saving throw, freeing itself on a success. While a creature is restrained in this way, you cannot use the chain to make other attacks.

Burning Chain:
You deal an additional acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice when you use this feature) equal to one martial arts die.

Luring Chain:
If the creature is one size larger than you or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

        <text>As an action, you can spend 4 ki points and punch a hole in the fabric of reality. Every creature within 10 feet of you, besides yourself, must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d12 force damage and moves forward in time. A target moved forward in time vanishes until the start of your next turn. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in an unoccupied space nearest to that space if it is occupied. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

    <!-- Way of the Warshaper -->

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Warshaper (HB)</name>
        <text>Form is fluid. Shape is a weapon. Release yourself from the constraints of your body and you can become made for war. Thus teaches the way of the warshaper, whose members learn how to alter their form on the fly. Though they do not focus on the full transformations that a druid's wild shape might, they can grow claws and teeth, flow around attacks, rebuild their shattered body, and other similar changes.

Monks who follow the way of the warshaper are often forthright defenders of the downtrodden, but not always. Their control over their own form can make them relentless, terrifying hunters able to infiltrate past defenders and terminate their targets without fail.

        <name>Way of the Warshaper (HB): Warshaping Technique</name>
        <text>You have mastered the core techniques of warshaping, allowing you to rebuild your body into whatever you need it to do at the time. When you use your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind monk features, you can choose to shift your form into some- thing more suited to your action.

Flurry of Blows:
You grow natural weapons such as claws and teeth or otherwise shift part of your body into a weapon, such as a bone spike. Choose bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing; until the start of your next turn, your unarmed attacks deal damage of the chosen type. In addition, if you hit a single target with both attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows feature, you deal extra damage to the target equal to one Martial Arts die.

Patient Defense:
You grow a hard shell, resilient scales, or another natural defense feature. You have resistance to the damage of the first attack that hits you before the start of your next turn.

Step of the Wind:
You grow small wings, gliding flaps, or some other feature that helps you travel through the air. Until the end of your turn, your jumping distance triples instead of doubles and you are immune to damage from falling.

        <name>Way of the Warshaper (HB): Rebuilding of Body</name>
        <text>You know how to rebuild your damaged body, and how to reshape yourself to avoid and recover from damage.

As a reaction, you can reshuffle your organs to turn any critical hit against you into a normal hit instead. Whenever you spend ki points to use your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind features in combat, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).

        <name>Way of the Warshaper (HB): Ancient Warbeast</name>
        <text>You have mastered the techniques required to remold your form and gain the powers of an ancient warbeast. You can assume this new form as a bonus action. This form lasts for 1 hour, until you are reduced to zero hit points, or until you dismiss the effect as an action. While you are in this form, you gain the following benefits.

	• Your size is Large.

	• If your Strength score is lower than your Dexterity score, it increases to match your Dexterity score.

	• Your Martial Arts die is 1d12.

	• Your unarmed attacks deal your choice of bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.

	• You gain darkvision for a radius of 120 feet, tremorsense for a radius of 60 feet, or blindsight for a radius of 30 feet (your choice when you transform).

You can choose the details of the appearance of this form each time you assume it. A terrifying hybrid of humanoid and ancient beast that time forgot is the most common. You might choose to take the form of a six-legged beast with savage claws and bloodshot eyes, a shaggy-furred minotaur with great piercing horns, a scaled serpentine body with eerily muscular arms extending from below its head, or any other beast form hybrid you can imagine. Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest.
