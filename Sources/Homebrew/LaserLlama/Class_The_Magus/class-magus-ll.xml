    <trait>
      <name>The Magus</name>
      <text>As the swordsman made his way through the busy marketplace, his eyes flashed green for a brief moment. He could see the unmistakable aura of arcane magic surrounding the humble dwarf shopping for wares. He had found his target. As the warrior drew his blade, what had appeared to be a mere dwarf peasant seconds before reverted to its true form. As the demon lunged forward, the swordsman met claw with his blade.

The assassin watched as the Duke walked the streets with a single guard at his side. As the would-be assassin's blade darted toward the Duke's exposed neck, glee turned to fear as the armored guard appeared where the Duke had been moments before. Before the killer could react, a blade of emerald flame had pierced his chest.

The halfling knelt before the three hooded figures that stood before her. She had spent nearly two years of her life searching for a member of this secret order, and now she had found three. Consumed by sorrow after her father's death at the hands of a wicked sorcerer, the young halfling swore she would do whatever it took to gain the power to exact her revenge. Now that the moment was at hand, she swore fealty to the secretive order, offering up her life in return for power.

All three of the warriors described above are Magi, users of sword and spell, weaving both together in a deadly dance.

    <trait>
      <name>Sword &amp; Spell</name>
      <text>Known by many names throughout the multiverse, those who are able to wield both sword and spell are collectively known as Magi. Rather than dedicate their lives to studying arcane magic or mastering martial techniques, Magi are dedicated to a middle path. Though they may never command the earth-shattering magic of an archmage, or go toe to toe with a true master of the blade, a Magus is able to master a unique form of arcane combat only used by the members of their Order.

Their signature style of magic allows them to channel spells through their weapon strikes, sense the presence of arcane magic in the world around them, and even strike the weaves of spells from the air before they can take effect.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Secret Orders</name>
      <text>The magic of the Magi is not something everyone can learn. Over time, these arcane warriors have organized themselves into clandestine societies, content to operate in the shadows. Potential Magi are often identified from a young age and are inducted into an Order only after they have proven their skill and dedication. While some Orders are more secretive than others, nearly every Order of Magi is thought to be nothing more than legend to the vast majority common folk.

As Magi rise through the ranks of their secret society, they are expected to infiltrate and form relationships with those in positions of power. They often set themselves up as personal advisors, guards, and consorts to influential nobles, powerful archmages, and wealthy merchants. Though Magi may form relationships, their primary loyalty is always to their Order.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Warlock</name>
      <text>Those who pursue life as a Magus often give up everything in order to be accepted and trained by a master. What motivates your Magus? Have you always had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and skill? Was one of your loved ones slain by an evil mage, setting you on the path of revenge, no matter the personal cost? Or, do you simply desire to increase your skill with both sword and sorcery in tandem with one another?

Also, decide where you acquired your training as a Magi. Are you an initiate in a secret society of arcane warriors? Or, were you trained in secret by a renegade member of an order of powerful magi who work to control the world? Maybe you were raised from birth so as to perfectly develop your talent in the art of war alongside your arcane potential.

Quick Build:
You can make a Magus quickly by using these suggestions. First, depending on the weapons you wish to use, make your Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by your Intelligence. Second, choose the Sage background.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Warlock</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the magus as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a magus.

	• Intelligence 13
	• Either Strength or Dexterity 13

Proficiencies Gained:
If magus isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a magus.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons

        <name>Arcane Armory</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you learn the signature enchantment of the Magi, marking you as a member of their ranks. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can touch one melee weapon, shield, or set of armor to perform a ritual adding the item to your Arcane Armory. Your Arcane Armory is an extradimensional space that only its Magus can access.

Objects in your Arcane Armory gain the following benefits:

	• They count as magical weapons, shields, or sets of armor.

	• You can use your Intelligence, in place of Dexterity, when calculating Armor Class in this light and medium armor, so long as you do not already add it to your Armor Class.

	• As a bonus action, you can shunt or summon any number of objects of your choice from within your Arcane Armory, instantly equipping, donning, or doffing those items.

Your Arcane Armory can hold a total number of objects equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1) at one time, but one of those objects must always be a weapon. If you perform this ritual on another object while the Armory is at its maximum, one object of your choice is removed.

      <feature>
        <name>Fighting Style</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you adopt a Fighting Style that best reflects your training. You cannot select a Fighting Style more than once, even if a feature allows you to select another Fighting Style.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can switch your Fighting Style for another Fighting Style of your choice.

Arcane Warrior:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list, and Intelligence is your Spellcasting modifier for them.

At 2nd level, they become Magus spells for you, but they don't count against your total number of Cantrips Known.

Archery:
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.

Classical Swordplay:
While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and a +1 to Armor Class so long as you are not using heavy armor or a shield.

Defensive Fighting:
While you are wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

Dual Wielding:
While two-weapon fighting, you make your off-hand weapon attack as part of the Attack action instead of a bonus action, and can add your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

When you do, you cannot also make a bonus action attack.

Dueling:
When wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to weapon damage rolls.

Protector:
When a creature you can see attacks you, or a target within 5 feet, you can use a reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or melee weapon to gain this benefit.

Shield Warrior:
You gain proficiency with shields as a martial melee weapon, and on hit, your shield deals 2d4 bludgeoning damage. If you are wielding a shield and nothing else, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with your shield and to your Armor Class.

Thrown Weapon Fighting:
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. Moreover, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of that attack.

Versatile Fighting:
While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon. While doing so, you can also use your bonus action to make a single grapple or shove attack, or to take the Use an Object action.

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you have learned to cast arcane spells, much like a Wizard, which you use to enhance your abilities in combat:

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Magus spell list, which can be found at the end of this class description. You learn another Magus cantrip at 4th and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Magus table.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use any weapon or shield within your Arcane Armory as a spellcasting focus for your Magus spells. They can also be used to perform the somatic components of Magus spells.

You can also use an Arcane Focus as a spellcasting focus.

Spell Slots:
The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast a spell you know, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots each time you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level &amp; Up:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Magus spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magus table shows when you learn more Magus spells. Each Magus spell you learn must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 6th level, you learn a spell of your choice from the Magus spell list of either 1st-level or 2nd-level.

Whenever you gain a Magus level, you can choose one Magus spell you know and replace it with another Magus spell of your choice, of a level that you have spell slots for.

Spellcasting Ability:
As you commit your spells to memory, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Magus spells. Use Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when you set a saving throw DC, or when you make a spell attack roll.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

      <feature>
        <name>Spellstrike</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your spells through weapons.

Once per turn when you would make an attack, you can cast a Magus spell, expending a spell slot as normal, and make an attack with a melee Arcane Armory weapon. To be channeled through a Spellstrike attack in this way, the spell must meet the following requirements:

	• The Magus spell must have a casting time of 1 action.

	• The Magus spell must require a single spell attack roll, force its target to make a saving throw, or affect a total number of hit points worth of creatures (like sleep).

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately after the normal effects and damage of your weapon attack, using the rules below:

Area of Effect:
If the spell targets an area greater than a 10-foot cube, it takes effect as a 15-foot cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice on hit).

Cantrips:
You do not deal the damage of the cantrip along with the damage of your weapon attack. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip's additional effects, other than damage, on hit.

Concentration:
If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.

Saving Throws:
If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the initial saving throw at disadvantage on hit. If you score a critical hit on the attack, it automatically fails this saving throw. Other targets (if any) save as normal.

Spell Attacks:
If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it instantly takes effect when you hit with your weapon attack.
