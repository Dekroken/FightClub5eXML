        <name>Esoteric Order: Order of Armorers</name>
        <text>Magi of the Order of Armorers claim to be the students of the original Magus, the creator of the enchantment which would become the Arcane Armory. While every Order now shares in the knowledge of this enchantment, only Armorers can use it to its fullest potential. These warriors learn to summon their Arcane Armory as deadly projectiles for use in battle.

        <name>Order of Armorers: Awakened Armory</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can summon any number of the one-handed melee weapons within your Arcane Armory, causing them to levitate around you in your space. This requires your concentration. If it ends, the weapons return to your Armory.

While levitating, these weapons have the Thrown (20/60) property, you use your Intelligence, in place of your Strength or Dexterity for their attack and damage rolls, and you are considered to be wielding the weapons one-handed. You can only attack with each levitating blade once per turn.

Whenever you can normally make an attack, you can make an attack with one of these levitating blades, then it instantly returns to levitate in your space regardless of a hit or miss.
