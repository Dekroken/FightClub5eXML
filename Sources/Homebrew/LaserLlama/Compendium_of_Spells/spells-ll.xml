    <text>You attempt to transmute a creature into stone. As an action, you touch a creature, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, it isn't affected.

A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails three saves, it is turned to stone and petrified. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature fails or passes three saves.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration for the entire duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of saves it must fail before it is petrified is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for each level above 4th.

The creature instantly dies if it cannot survive without the lost head. The creature's head is not removed if it is immune to slashing damage, or if it doesn't have or need a head.
