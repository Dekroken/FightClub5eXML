      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Invigorating Strike (Oath of the Hospitalier)</name>
        <text>As an action, you can imbue your strikes with positive energy that heals you and your allies, using your Channel Divinity. For one minute, your melee attacks are considered to be magical and whenever you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you or an ally within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Shield the Weak (Oath of the Hospitalier)</name>
        <text>As an action, you can swear a magical vow to protect an injured ally, using your Channel Divinity. Choose a creature other than yourself that has less than their maximum hit point total. For one minute, any hostile creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you has disadvantage on all attack rolls against that target, and the target has advantage on all saving throws against spells and abilities originating from those creatures. This effect ends if the target is restored to full hit points or if you can no longer perceive any creatures that are hostile to the target.</text>

        <name>Aura of Care (Oath of the Hospitalier)</name>
        <text>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage, and treat any effects of exhaustion as 1 lower (a 7th level still causes death). At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</text>

        <name>Rejuvenating Hands (Oath of the Hospitalier)</name>
        <text>At 15th level, you add an additional 25 points to your Lay on Hands pool. When you expend 5 points from your pool of healing to cure diseases, you also remove one level of exhaustion.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Knight Protector (Oath of the Hospitalier)</name>
        <text>At 20th level, a ghost-like translucent full plate armor appears around your body and radiates an aura that protects your allies from harm. When you use your action to activate this feature, for 1 hour, a soft glow emanates from you, shedding bright light from you in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a 30-foot radius. While the light shines, you gain the following benefits:</text>
        <text/>
        <text>&#8226; You and your allies within 30 feet are immune to being blinded, charmed, deafened and have advantage on saving throws to avoid being paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or stunned. On any of these conditions which you or your allies are immune to, immediately end when you activate the ability.</text>
        <text/>  
        <text>&#8226; You and allies within 30 feet of you also have advantage on death saving throws.</text>
        <text>    Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</text>
