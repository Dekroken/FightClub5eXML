    <text>This frosty breastplate and fur set is enchanted to keep its wearer at a constant, comfortable temperature. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to cold and fire damage and ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. In addition, you can cast the ice storm spell (save DC 16) at 6th level using the armor. When cast in this way, the spell is centered on your location and you are immune to its effects. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

    <text>This elegant rapier grants its wielder unparalleled grace in combat. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Duelist Parry: When another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

Duelist Riposte: When another creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that enemy.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: martial, rapier
