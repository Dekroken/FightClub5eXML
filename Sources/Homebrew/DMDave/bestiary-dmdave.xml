    <description>What Does Zeek Want? Ultimately, Zeek wants to be left alone to his own devices. Sometimes, his needs cause troubleâ€”for example, he may require the blood of a virgin to complete a spell. And he's been known to accidentally open doors to the Other here and there. This events draw attention to adventurers.

    <description>What Do Zeek's Henchchickens Want? Overall, most of Zeek's henchchickens are okay with their current predicament. After all, the work is good and there's plenty of seeds to go around. However, some do long to become human again.

    <description>The Nature of Swarms.
      ------
      The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.
