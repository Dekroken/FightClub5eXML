  <description>With nothing but their wits, will, and fists, pugilists lay it all on the table every time they're in for a scrap. No strangers to adversity, pugilists can dish it out, take a licking and still keep coming back for more. A pugilist's unbreakable spirit and talent for fisticuffs don't come from rigorous training or high minded philosophies but are the hard won trophies of never backing down from a fight no matter the odds.

All pugilists belong to a Fight Club, an informal fraternity of brawlers with similar style, that shapes the way they fight. Fight Clubs included in the full version of the Pugilist class are: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Dog &amp; Hound, Hand of Dread, Piss &amp; Vinegar, the Squared Circle, and the Sweet Science. Whether you're interested in playing an adventuring luchador, a boxer fighting the good fight, or a hard-nosed detective with a penchant for pugilism, these Fight Clubs have you covered!</description>
