The draconic avatar exhales a powerful blast of its damage type. If the damage type is acid or lightning, the breath weapon is a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide and requires a Dexterity save against your spell save DC. If the damage type is cold, fire, or poison, the breath weapon is a 30-foot cone and requires a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (11d6) damage of your patron's damage type, or half that on a successful save.</text>
