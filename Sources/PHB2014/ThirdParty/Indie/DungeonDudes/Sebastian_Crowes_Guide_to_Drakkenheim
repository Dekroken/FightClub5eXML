        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spell Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.

Arcane Focus

You can use a monk weapon as an arcane focus for your spellcasting.

Cantrips

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.
You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots

The Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell thunderwave and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast thunderwave using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. 

The Spells Known column of the Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of1st level or higher of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through contemplation and meditation. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <text>Beginning at 17th level, you can store spells cast by other creatures in your bag. Your bag can store up to 6 levels worth of spells at a time.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into your bag by touching the bag as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in your bag. If your bag can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

Alternatively, you can place a spell scroll in the bag. The spell is cast and stored in your bag and the spell scroll is destroyed. You can cast any spell stored in your bag. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the bag is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

This is a golden two finger ring worn on the second and third finger. The ring is set with a large diamond in the center and three smaller sapphires on either side.

The ring has three charges. You can use your action and expend one charge from the ring to try to make a humanoid creature forget the details of a conversation you've had with it in the past hour, replacing its memories with an alternative explanation you provide (limited to a short sentence or two). The explanation must sound plausible, and immediately fails if you imply the target made any sort of agreement, choices, or decisions. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it loses its memories of the conversation with you and accepts your explanation regarding what occurred. On a successful saving throw, the target isn't aware you tried to affect its memories.

All expended charges are replenished each day at dawn.

    <text>This item is one of the Six Seals of Elyria.

This large feathered quill with is made from the plucked feather of an angel. While attuned to this quill, you can read, write, and speak all languages. You always know if you read or hear a lie, and immediately determine if a document is a forgery if you hold it in your hands. You have truesight out to a range of 30 feet.

You can fold a document written using this quill, then write the name of a creature familiar to you on the page or an envelope. Once you do, the document and envelope whisk away towards the creature, flying through the air and slipping through thin cracks to reach them. No matter where the creature is in the world, it reaches them within 1 hour.

    <text>A wave of poisonous fumes emanates from you. Creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, each creature takes 4d12 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and does not become poisoned.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 4th

    <text>Until the spell ends, acid rain falls in a 40-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is lightly obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Chemical pools accumulate on the ground in the area, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 3d6 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone in the pools, taking an additional 3d6 acid damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You banish a creature that you can see within range into the Space Between Worlds. Upon this roiling plane of chaotic potential, the target wanders incomprehensible vistas searching for a way back via strange and absurd exits. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes.

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes an Intelligence check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. On a failed check, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

Time passes differently for the target within the Space Between Worlds, and it perceives its time spent there as having lasted hundreds or perhaps thousands of years, even if it was only gone for rounds or minutes in the mortal world.

A creature which dies in the Space Between Worlds does not return.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You create two Large hands of shimmering, octarine force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hands last for the spell's duration. Both hands move at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hands.

Each hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If one or both of the hands drop to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Each hand has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0) and occupies its space.

When you cast the spell, and as an action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with each. Both hands can perform the same action, or different ones. The two hands must move to remain within 30 feet of each other.

&gt; Arcane Slam. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage. If you direct both hands to attack the same target, they gain advantage on the attack roll.

&gt; Forceful Throw. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. If both hands are used against the same target, you can throw them ten times your spellcasting ability modifier, and gain advantage on the check against a Large or smaller target.

&gt; Eldritch Grip. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If both the hands are used against the same target, they can grapple a creature regardless of its size, and you have advantage on the grapple check against a Large or smaller target.

&gt; Contaminated Crush. You can have a hand crush a target it is grappling. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Contamination Level. If both the hands are grappling the same target, you can have them rip the grappled target limb from limb. They deal an extra 4d12 necrotic damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the arcane slam and contaminated crush options increases by 2d12 and the damage from the eldritch grip increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You weave contaminated energy to temporarily imbue a creature within range with a beneficial mutation. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

&gt; Strength. The target has advantage on Strength attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its melee weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage for the spell's duration.

&gt; Constitution. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the spell's duration.

&gt; Dexterity. The target has advantage on Dexterity attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its attacks with ranged and finesse weapons score a critical hit on an 18‚Äì20 for the spell's duration.

&gt; Intelligence. The target has advantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, while the target is concentrating on a spell it has cast, it's concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

&gt; Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, it gains blindsight to a range of 60 feet and can't be surprised while it is conscious.

&gt; Charisma. The target has advantage on Charisma ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. In addition, the target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, when the target makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose one additional effect for every two slot levels above 2nd.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call down eldritch falling stars that crash into the earth at four points you can see within range. Each creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 radiant damage, 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 thunder damage, 10d6 psychic damage, and 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one burst is affected only once.

The falling stars leave lasting contamination in the areas they affect, which lasts for one hour. A creature that starts its turn within the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level. It takes half as much damage and does not gain any Contamination Levels on a successful save. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately undergoes a Monstrous Transformation as if they had gained 6 Contamination Levels.

The spell damages structures and objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

In addition, a creature hit with a melee attack using the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes poisoned until the end of the attacker's next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>A flock of floating spectral hands appear and grasp a target you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw. A target takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, on a failed saving throw the ghostly hands grapple the target until the end of your next turn, and immediately move the target up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice (but not upward). On its turn, the creature can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple by making a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, the grapple ends.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the grasping ghost can target one additional creature within range for each spell level above 2nd.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell transforms a willing creature that you touch into a horrific monstrosity. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.

The new form can be an aberration with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower.

The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen aberration. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

In addition to a delerium fragment worth 100gp, you must provide either the heart or brain (or equivalent organ in the case of aberrations with a truly alien physiology) taken from a creature of the same type: the organ must either be recently harvested or magically preserved via gentle repose or similar magic. As part of casting the spell, you drive the delerium fragment into the organ, and both are consumed by the spell. The Game Master determines if an aberration's physiology makes its organs suitable for use with this spell.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, emits toxic fumes. It deals 8d8 poison damage to each creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of that side or inside the wall.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You create a sword-shaped plane of contaminated energy that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 4d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level.

While infected, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed saving throw, it takes 10d8 necrotic damage and becomes incapacitated until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not incapacitated.  An infected creature must make the saving throw at the start of each of its turns until it dies or is cured.

A creature who starts its turn within 10 feet of a creature infected by this spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, that creature contracts the infection.

When you cast the spell, you can choose yourself and up to eight other creatures to be unaffected by the infection caused by this casting of the spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You seize upon the flow of time around up to three creatures of your choice within range, drawing seconds from them to use them yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target can't take reactions. On its turn, it must choose to either move, take an action, or a bonus action: a target can do only one of the three.

A creature affected by this spell can spend its action to try to pull back the threads of time. If it does, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

While at least one other creature is affected by this spell, you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. If you use this action to cast a spell, that spell must be a cantrip with a casting time of one action.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target the same creature or a different one, but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of stream of consumption.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call forth a contaminated elemental to do your bidding. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. Eldritch energy conjures a contaminated elemental of the chosen type, which appears in an unoccupied space within range: either an animated sludge (water), entropic flame (fire), living haze (air), or walking geode (earth). Each uses the summoned delerium elemental stat block below, but gains different traits based on the chosen element used to conjure the elemental. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal command you give it (no action required by you). If you don't give any commands, it attacks the closest hostile creature it can see, moving towards it by the most direct route.

The elemental doesn't disappear if you lose concentration on this spell. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it attacks you. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it remains until it is destroyed.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

    <text>This eldritch spell summons a manifestation of the Thing with the Writhing Tail, a mysterious entity with a vaguely feline form which dwells in the Space Between Worlds. Perhaps it is the favoured cat of Phantasia, or a fragment of Shegorach, but to others, it is simply known by the odd name "Bruce".

You call forth The Thing with the Writhing Tail. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the stat block below. The creature
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

    <text>Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 200 poison damage. This damage ignores any resistance or immunity the creature has to poison damage, and can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

The potent poison lingers in the targets body and pulls it towards death. A target reduced to zero hit points by this poison damage automatically fails death saving throws until it finishes a long rest. A heal or greater restoration spell cast on the target also ends this effect.

On a failed save, the target is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer poisoned.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell.

When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell allows you to control gravity in a 100-foot-cube centered on a point within range. When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration, you decide which direction gravity pulls within the area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall in the direction you choose until they reach the edge of the area. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the edge of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

Alternatively, you can decide to prevent gravity from acting within the area. When you do, creatures within the area levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

When you cast this spell, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Space Between Worlds (avoiding the triggering damage). At the start of your next turn, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near).

While within the Space Between Worlds, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast as a roiling blur, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures in the Space Between Worlds. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

You weave an impossible sign from an inscrutable reality in the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. It appears for only a moment before vanishing. Each creature in the area who sees the sign must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature becomes blinded and stunned for the spell's duration. On a successful saving throw, a creature is blinded until the end of your next turn.

The spell ends for a stunned creature if it takes any damage, or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. When the spell ends for a stunned creature, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the siren is disguised.</text>

    <description>This floating mass of wet flabby flesh drifts through the air, its many long spindly tendrils dangling down like some form of incomprehensible jellyfish. Oftentimes these creatures appear in strange hues of pale pinks, purples, and whites. Their large eye placed in the middle of their fleshy mass glows with octarine hues and their gaze weakens the body and mind. The soft sound of thrumming and suckling follows them as insane chattering of unknown languages murmur in the minds of those unfortunate enough to behold these creatures that drift through the thin places into our world.

    <description>The Lurker on the Threshold is a vile and maniacal being, drifting into our realm through thin places and screaming in the minds of those it witnesses. It laughs in hysterical dissonant tones and peers out with its three unblinking dark pools of eyes, with a mass of fleshy tendrils dangling from its slimy form. It ripples with black voidlike hues and splashes of deep purples and blues as if its flesh was a moving image of the cosmos.

    <description>These strange arachnid-like creatures seem to weave together partial realities, parallel dimensions, and alternate timelines like a spider spinning its web. They have features that resemble that of a large spider, but their twisted forms, elongated torso, fanged maws, and spiny hides give them an otherworldly guise that makes them hard to distinguish as anything from this plane of existence. Those who have faced one have commented on the broken sense of reality that occurs when attempting to attack an eldritch crawler.

Rather than a head, the top of its massive body has two beady rodent-like eyes and rat-like features. Upon its belly is a large gaping maw filled with jagged teeth and a massive purple tongue slurping and slathering gobs of vile saliva out of it as it drags itself towards its next meal.

    <description>Many of the northern warriors have adopted the title "reaver". Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

    <description>Riding throughout the jungles of Terene atop great Clawstrider Raptors or other giant lizards, the Rangers are skilled at guerrilla tactics and mounted combat, often wearing camouflaged leather armor reinforced with jungle leaves and hardwoods. The Clawstriders are a fearsome and stealthy force. If you see a lone ranger in the jungles, you are already surrounded.

    <description>The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

    <description>Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>Inherited Silver:

Rickard Steelfang's unique curse means that normal silvered weapons are not effective against him. Instead, the weapon must be made specifically from silver that was passed down to the wielder from a now-deceased friend or family member. The weapon need not be in the original form the silver was inherited in. For example, a character could make silver arrowheads or crossbow bolts by melting down a silver locket given to them by their grandmother.

5 The target takes 6d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

6 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

7 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains 1 level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

8 The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll on this table twice more. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.</text>

    <description>This extremely withdrawn Academy Director dwells on the moon. Although they typically interact with mortals in the guise of a human wizard, Amaranthyst is in fact an ancient delerium dragon. Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.

Personality Trait. How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.

Ideal. A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.

Bond. Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.

Flaw. I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unravelled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.

Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

      <name>Apothecary</name>
      <text>A bespectacled man stands at an operating table, studying the dissected monstrosity resting upon the slab. The crackle of electric conductors harmonize with his arcane mumblings as he takes up his scalpels and saws. As he finishes the final stitch, the creature's hand twitches and jolts to life once more.

Cloaked in an acid-stained heavy coat, a tall half-elf brews tinctures and tonics. Her face is concealed behind thick black goggles and a heavy breathing mask as she performs an unusual combination of herbalism, alchemy, medicine, and magic. Her mixtures bubble and boil as she muses whether the cure will be worse than the disease.

A lithe tiefling soothes a suffering patient as they draw a sample of contaminated blood. Lifting the vial to examine the liquid within, they pull upon eldritch energy to distill the sample into a pure contagion. Scribbling their findings down in a withered notebook, they add the vial to their collection of pathogens and scourges to use against their foes.

    <trait>
      <name>Medical Experts</name>
      <text>An apothecary is a practiced medical expert and arcane magic user. They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose.

Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Knowledge Seekers</name>
      <text>Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world.

They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between, riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Occult Practicioners</name>
      <text>Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work. Apothecaries are gaining renown within some remote communities on the continent as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating an Apothecary</name>
      <text>When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working in the service of good? Is your life dedicated to helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells?

All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories.

Quick Build

You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose your character ancestry and background. Third, choose the poison needle* and spare the dying cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells envenom* and healing word.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Optional Rule: Multiclassing</name>
      <text>If you allow characters to use the Multiclassing optional rules, here are the requirements for multiclassing with the Apothecary. 

Ability Score Minimum. Multiclass characters must meet ability score prerequisites for both their current class(es) and their new one. Taking multiclass levels as an Apothecary requires an Intelligence score of 13 or higher.

Proficiencies. If apothecary isn't your initial class, when you take your first level as an apothecary you gain proficiency in light armor and one tool proficiency of your choice.

        <name>Multiclass Apothecary</name>
        <text>If you allow characters to use the Multiclassing optional rules, here are the requirements for multiclassing with the Apothecary. 

Ability Score Minimum. Multiclass characters must meet ability score prerequisites for both their current class(es) and their new one. Taking multiclass levels as an Apothecary requires an Intelligence score of 13 or higher.

Proficiencies. If apothecary isn't your initial class, when you take your first level as an apothecary you gain proficiency in light armor and one tool proficiency of your choice.

        <name>Apothecary Magic</name>
        <text>Your arcane research has given you facility with spells. Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.

Formula Book

You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your esoteric theories, and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:

	 ‚Ä¢ A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock

	‚Ä¢  A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope

	‚Ä¢ A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship

	‚Ä¢ A leather briefcase with two small golden locks

	‚Ä¢ A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides

	‚Ä¢ A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket

If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.

Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.

Elementary Reformulation. 

Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.

Preparing and Casting Spells

The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. 

	You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.

For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Ritual Casting

You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.

Apothecary Spells Known:

Level | Spells Known

1 | 1 + your intelligence modifier (minimum of one spell)

A Reanimator's skills at clutching life from the jaws of death make them exquisitely suited for dealing with death, and undeath.

        <name>Corpsewrought Creature (Reanimator)</name>
        <text>You have constructed a companion from scavenged body parts and brought it to life with your occult magic: a corpsewrought creature. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Corpsewrought Creature stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You can determine the

cosmetic characteristics of the creature; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the creature can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. If your corpsewrought creature has died within the last hour, you can use your healer's kit as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend an apothecary spell slot. The corpsewrought companion returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new corpsewrought creature if you have your healer's kit with you and access to suitable "materials." If you already have a corpsewrought creature from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The creature also perishes if you die.

A rare few wrestle the madness of the Haze through a supernatural rage which allows them to channel the eldritch energies of delerium. These Haze Ragers thrive on the contaminated power of delerium, transforming madness and fear into a weapon.

        <name>Divine Domain: Shadow Domain</name>
        <text>Clerics of the Sacred Flame know that life is at all times a balance between the light and the dark. Most clerics uphold the flame, whose divine purpose is to hold back the darkness, and offer guidance to those who pass on. Clerics of the Shadow Domain are in tune with the dark side of the divine. They stand to balance all things, practicing the powers of shadow against their enemies. They know that not all deserve the light, and so sending foul horrors to the shadows is their form of righteous justice.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Cloak of the Night (Shadow Domain)</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke protective shadows. 

As an action, you draw upon a curtain of magical shadow which lasts for 1 minute. When you do, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to be enveloped by the cloak of the night (which can be yourself). While the cloak lasts, that creature has resistance to all damage while it is in dim light or darkness.

In addition, when you draw the cloak of night, all nonmagical light sources within 60 feet of you become extinguished. Magical light sources are dispelled if they were created by a spell with a level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus.

        <text>You can twist shadow around other creatures to pull them through space.

As an action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that is in dim light or darkness. You teleport that creature up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC is unaffected
.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Contamination</name>
        <text>As druids are often in tune with nature and the natural order, most see delerium as a scourge upon the world. However, a rare few see the truth: the eldritch stones are an essential part of the natural order, one which works at a cosmic scale. Druids of the Circle of Contamination use the blighted rocks and contaminating Haze as a conduit for supernatural evolution. They have embraced the chaotic power of Delerium as an extension of the inherent chaos in the natural order, spreading the Haze while wielding it as a powerful ally to fuel their spells.

        <text>At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch and poison needle (HB) cantrips. These don't count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells ilsted for that level in the Circle of Contamination Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Druid Level	| Spells

3rd	|	Biohazard (HB), Controlled Mutation (HB)
5th	|	Purge Contamination (HB), Venomous Aura (HB)
7th	|	Horrific Transformation (HB), Poison Wave (HB)
9th	|	Acid Rain (HB), Toxic Barrage (HB)

        <name>Blighted Magic (Circle of Contamination)</name>
        <text>Your magic becomes a twisted mockery of druidic principles, and you can twist your spells to suit your needs. Your spells which conjure creatures or natural flora and fauna now appear like sickly, fleshy tentacles, and animals you summon are cancerous and mutated. In addition, when you cast a spell, you can choose one of the following blighted magic options:

	Twin Spell. If the spell you cast targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level.

	Quicken Spell. When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the spell as a bonus action.

	Corrupt Spell. When you roll damage for a spell, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to change the damage type of all damage caused by the spell to necrotic. In addition, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). You must use the new rolls.

	Purify Spell. When you cast a contaminated spell (found in Chapter 4), you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the spell without gaining a Contamination Level.

You can cast the purge contamination* spell as an action without expending a spell slot. You don't need to provide the material components when you cast the spell in this way, and the target does not gain any exhaustion levels from this casting of the spell. When you cast purge contamination* in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

component, or gaining a contamination level, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. When you do, the spell's duration for that casting changes to 1 minute.

Creatures of your choice which start their turn within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Those who fail the save take 3d6 necrotic damage. A creature who fails this saving throw by 5 or more gains one Contamination Level.

A creature which makes a successful saving throw against your Haze Aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours.
