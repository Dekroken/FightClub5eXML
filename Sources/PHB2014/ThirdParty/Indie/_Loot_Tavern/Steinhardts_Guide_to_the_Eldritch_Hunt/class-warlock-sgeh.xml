        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Trigger</name>
        <text>You can use your action to draw upon the powers of your Patron and create a hex gun in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this spellcasting focus takes each time you create it. It can either be a Revolver or a Sniper (detailed below).
	Your hex gun disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss it (no action required), or if you die.
	Your hex gun acts as a spellcasting focus, and when you cast cantrips with it, it channels them as bullets (these still count as spells). Instead of increasing the damage of the cantrip when you reach certain levels, you can cast the cantrip additional times as part of the same action (except for Eldritch Blast, which is cast as normal). To be cast in this way, the cantrip must deal damage, must make a spell attack or require a saving throw, and must have a range other than self.
	When you cast a cantrip in this manner, you cast it 2 times at 5th level, 3 times at 11th level, and 4 times at 17th level. The cantrip can deal its damage more than once, but its other effects can't be applied again.

Revolver Form: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun. While wielding this weapon, you know the shocking grasp cantrip.

Sniper Form: Your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun have their range doubled and ignore half-cover. While wielding this weapon, you know the ray of frost cantrip.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Void (HB)</name>
        <text>These warlocks have made a pact with an eldritch being from the deepest depths of the Cosmos—a being that devours energy, holds the secrets of creation, and paves the way to the apocalypse. Pray that they are not aware of your presence. A deep fascination for the cosmos, or perhaps profound meditation on the heat death of the universe could've brought about the circumstances that lead to this pact. Very few are able to withstand such knowledge and power, and the few that do are often seen as mysterious and reclusive figures.
	Warlocks who strike a pact with the Void walk an eerie and dangerous path, focused on manipulating gravity and harnessing the immense power of black holes. Crushing their foes in condensed wells of gravity, whilst liberating themselves from the shackles that hold them, these warlocks carve their own destiny under the guidance of the cosmos.

        <name>Fugite Omnis (The Void (HB))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you can partially ignore the shackles of gravity. You gain the ability to hover a few inches off the ground. You can ascend and descend as part of your movement. You can't hover more than a foot above the ground and fall if you are above that height. If you were to be knocked prone while hovering, you are instead made to stand on the ground.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Voracious Void (The Void (HB))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, as a bonus action, you can create a miniature black hole, in the form of a 5-foot-diamater sphere, centered on a point on the ground that you can see within 60 feet. This black hole has a domain of influence of 5 feet beyond its own radius. It lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). The black hole is considered difficult terrain for all creatures except for you.
	When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the ability ends, unsecured objects within the domain of influence of the miniature black hole are pulled toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.
	As part of creating the sphere, and on subsequent turns as a bonus action, you can choose a creature within the domain of influence of the black hole, increasing the pull of gravity around them. They must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the black hole's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a warlock spell slot to use it again.

This miniature black hole grows with you. When your pact magic increases in power, so does this feature:

	• At 3rd level in this class, when a creature enters the black hole's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is restrained for the duration. A restrained creature can attempt to free itself by using an action to make an Athletics check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the black hole and is moved to the nearest unoccupied space outside the black hole.

	• At 5th level in this class, the domain of influence of the sphere increases to 10 feet and is considered difficult terrain for all creatures except for you. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while inside the black hole is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

	• At 7th level in this class, the diameter of the black hole increases to 10 feet.

	• At 9th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d6 and the sphere's domain of influence to 20 feet. You can summon the black hole at any point that you can see, not just on the ground. If the sphere is in the air, creatures restrained by it hover inside the black hole.

Note: The black hole and its domain of influence are two different things. At 3rd level, only the black hole, meaning the 5-foot diameter sphere at the center of your ravenous void, can restrain creatures.

        <text>At 6th level, when a creature you can see within 120 feet of you is targeted by a ranged attack, if your Voracious Void is active, you can use your reaction to divert the strike. If the attack passes through the miniature black hole or its domain of influence, you can make a ranged spell attack. If you roll higher than their attack roll, you deflect the trajectory and the target takes no damage. If you roll lower, you reduce the damage by 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. If you roll a 20, the attack is deflected and streaks towards the center of the black hole, randomly hitting one of the creatures inside, if any are present.

You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can grant these benefits to one creature that is touching you. They lose this flying speed immediately if they are no longer in contact with you.

        <text>At 14th level, you can unleash the ravenous hunger of the void. When you use your Voracious Void ability, you can choose to let it run wild. In that case, rather than as a bonus action, whenever a creature starts its turn within the black hole or its domain of influence, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled to the center. You and your choice of a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) aren't affected by this effect.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

    <text>Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Trigger feature (revolver form)

As a bonus action, you temporarily duplicate your hex gun to unleash a flurry of bullets. All creatures within a 15-foot cone in front of you must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 force damage. This damage increases to 3d10 at 11th level and 4d10 at 17th level. To use this bonus action, you need to be holding your hex gun in one hand and have the other hand free.
	You can use this invocation a number of times equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of twice),
and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As a bonus action, you can enhance your focus to see the weak spots of your foes. For the next minute, attacks you make using your hex gun score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Once you've used this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Your reflexes are honed. As a reaction, when an enemy makes a melee attack against you, before being hit, if your speed isn't 0, you can move 5 feet away from the foe without triggering opportunity attacks, potentially avoiding the attack if you leave its range.
	You can use this invocation a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you fire a cantrip through your hex gun, its non-damaging effects (such as the speed reduction from ray of frost) can apply multiple times but not more than once per creature.

Until the end of your turn, you enhance your hex gun. When you hit a creature with a cantrip cast with your hex gun, you can immediately cause the hit to wound a second creature within 15 feet of the original target. The second target takes damage (of the type of the cantrip) equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
	You can use this invocation to enhance your hex gun a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

When an enemy attacks you with a melee attack, you can fire a special bullet to counter it as a reaction before being hit. Make a melee or ranged spell attack. On a hit, the enemy takes 1d10 force damage, its attack fails, and it is stunned until the end of its current turn.
	Once you've used this invocation to damage an enemy, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
