    <text>This satchel contains various small implements that can bludgeon, cut, and pierce in ways designed to maximize pain. Meant to extract the truth, many use these tools with far more nefarious intentions. Proficiency with these tools grants the following benefits:

Exhaustion: Using these tools for 1 hour on a restrained creature causes them to gain 1 level of exhaustion, after which you must make a Dexterity (torture tools) check. The DC is equal to 20 - the creature's Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

Intimidation: When you make an Intimidation check against a creature whom you used these tools against, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus + twice the level of exhaustion the creature has.

    <text>This basic technology invented by the Scions sacrifices lead bullets to generate powerful azure flames that scorch the abhorrent. This device is an effort to replicate the magical ability possessed by a select few.
	As an action, you can cause the damascena to project blue flames in a 15-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 11 + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d4 fire damage + a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each use of the damascena consumes 5 lead bullets.

    <text>The aroma and appearance of this tea are undeniably repulsive, with seemingly still-living organisms squirming within it. However, for those who can stomach it, the tea offers impressive soothing properties.
	Known for temporarily alleviating the effects of madness, the darker the tea, the more potent and challenging to brew. Once ingested, the afflicted individual is relieved of the affected madness for 1 hour or until the madness ends, whichever is shorter. However, upon swallowing the tea, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC listed in the table below. On a failure, you can't stomach the appalling taste, regurgitate the tea, and don't gain the benefits.
	The tea is made in kettles that can pour up to 2d4 cups.

Yellow | 14 | All short-term; one long-term | rare
Blue | 16 | All short-term and long-term | very rare

    <text>A hand of glory is crafted from the hand of a hanged scourgeborne after it was covered in corpse wax and left to ferment in a casket.
	While holding the hand of glory, you can attune to one additional magical item. This magical item can only be a ring, and must be worn on the hand of glory.
	While holding the hand, you can use an action to set a digit of the hand ablaze and cast the invisibility spell on yourself. While a finger is ablaze, it casts bright light in a 10-foot radius that is only visible to the wearer of the hand. The spell ends early if the flame is extinguished by the wearer (no action required). In addition, while a finger is ablaze, you can cast the knock spell at will on objects within the radius of the light. The hand has 5 digits and regenerates 1 burnt digit daily at dusk.

    <name>Holy Tonic</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>P</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The mostly-clear tonic in this vial is slightly milky and sparkles when light shines through. It was originally created by a secretive branch of the Radiant Church.
	When you drink this tonic, you regain 4d4 + 4 hit points and are cured of all diseases you currently suffer from.

Side Effects:
Depending on the lore your game implements, the holy tonic can have one or more of the following side effects. These effects are hidden from player characters and no magic can reveal them.

	• If you fall unconscious within 1d12 minutes after drinking the holy tonic, you must succeed a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness when you regain consciousness.

	• 1 hour after you drink the holy tonic, you hear whispering voices urging you toward violence and chaos. You must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on any Persuasion checks for the next 1d4 hours. Additionally, for the duration, you are compelled to act on aggressive impulses as determined by the GM.

	• 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness.

	• 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or crave more holy tonic. For the next 1d4 hours, you desperately search for a holy tonic and drink the first one you find. If you do not drink one within this time, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the craving goes away.

	• Each subsequent holy tonic you drink in a 7-day period increases the DCs for the saving throws you must make by 1. Each three holy tonics you drink in a 7day period increases any exhaustion levels the tonic causes by 1.

	• If you fail five Wisdom saving throws caused by a holy tonic within a 7-day period, a curse fully takes hold. You undergo a horrifying transformation into a monstrous beast, losing control of your actions and permanently becoming a beast or monstrosity of the GM's choice under their control.

GM Note: Alternatively the holy tonic can restore 6d4+6 or 8d4+8 hit points.

    <text>Charged Shot: Once on each of your turns you can replace one of your cannon attacks with a charged shot. Instead of a regular attack, you let loose a ball of destruction and death. Each creature in a 120-footlong, 5-foot-wide line in front of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take 3d12 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
	You can use this property only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the property, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

Artillery. You must use Strength instead of Dexterity for the Firearm save DC and the attack and damage rolls of this weapon. Such a weapon can be fired once before it must be reloaded with an action.

Booming: The deflagration from firing this weapon makes a stupendous booming sound. The sound can be heard from up to 500 feet away. Firing this weapon makes it impossible to go undetected; you automatically fail Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it automatically succeeds on Perception checks against you.

Concussive: These weapons bludgeon as much as they pierce. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning damage. For instance, if a creature is immune to piercing damage and has no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance to all physical damage applies as normal.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

	This moongold inlaid cannon deals an extra 1d4 damage to any non-humanoid creatures it hits. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darknes; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	As a bonus action, you can rotate the dials on the cannon to infuse your loaded ammo with violent powers. Your next attack deals magical damage and you can choose one of the following effects.

Forceful Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone. Alternatively, if you are standing on a solid surface and instead fire the cannon directly at your feet, the explosion pushes you into the air and you land in a square of your choice within 30 feet of the explosion's origin.

Incendiary Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d4 fire damage.

Unstable Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 cold damage and the terrain in a 10-foot radius centered on the target is covered in arcane mist, becoming difficult terrain for the next minute.

    <text>The guillotine shears are a wonder of mechanical engineering, created to tend to Carmella's garden. Once used to cut excess foliage, it has now been repurposed to sever limbs instead of greenery. This trick weapon was given to hunters as a means of containing the scourge—if they couldn't kill the beasts, they could at least cripple them.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon-shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:

	• When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can't use the Guillotine property on this attack.

	• When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.

Untransformed: While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage.

Transformed: The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d10 slashing damage on a hit. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.

Guillotine: Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 1d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one-quarter of a creature's hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM's discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>When the manikin of the Sloered abattoir gained sentience, the Scions sent enforcers to quell this threat to Luyarnha's delicate existence. From the abbatoir's meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered-as the manikins named themselves-crafted these versatile weapons. Nicknamed "the meat hook", the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.

Untransformed: While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property.

Transformed: When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.

Hookshot: As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, the hook detaches from the creature and reattaches itself to the blunderbuss.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>One of the most versatile weapons of the church.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the sanctified partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.

Untransformed: Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction.

Transformed: This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced by 15 feet. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target's feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

In its transformed state, you break it over your knee and it's two sticks. The stick may only return to its untransformed state over the course of an hour as you use glue and bandages to bind the two pieces back together and wait for it to cure. It has the Ill Advised Weapon property.

Untransformed: It's a stick, has the light property, and if you hit with it, it deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

Transformed: It's two sticks, each held in a hand. A hit with either stick deals 1 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage (minimum of 0).

Ill Advised Weapon: When you attack with the stick, if you roll a 1 on the d20, it is destroyed and unusable. If this occurs during the transformed state of the stick, the stick not used in the attack remains, but cannot be untransformed. If the remaining stick also is destroyed by this property, you no longer have a stick.

    <text>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.

Untransformed: After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.

Transformed: Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.

    <text>Infused with otherworldly ichor, this dark blade is given to warriors of the Abyss Warden, forged from the remains of the monsters they've slain. The elegant and virtuous design of the weapon hides its macabre origins, mirroring the order it came from.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by sliding the pommel up and down on the blade. In its untransformed state, the abyss warden's axeblade is a longsword. In its transformed state, the weapon becomes a battleaxe. As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.
	Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>To gain the benefits of the cordyceps sinensis, you must ingest it, or graft it underneath your skin. For 24 hours, the fungus will incubate within you; during that time, if you swallow liquid flames or light the grafted area ablaze, you will kill the parasite. After 24 hours have passed, the only way to remove the parasite is with a remove curse spell cast at 6th level or higher. If you receive Nawre's Blessing, nothing short of a wish spell will remove the fungus.

While infected with the cordyceps sinensis, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

If you have Nawre's Blessing tattooed or carved onto your body, the parasite becomes a trick weapon for you. You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this magic weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a squashy tendril that emerges from your chest. In its transformed state, the parasite turns both your arms into grotesque elastic appendages of flesh.

Untransformed: The tendril is a simple melee weapon for you that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the reach property. You can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the weapon. In addition, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

Transformed: The tendrils infiltrate your arms, turning them into massive clobbering weapons. In this form, you cannot wield any weapon or shield in your hands. These tendrils count as simple melee weapons for you, deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and have the reach property. When you make an attack on your turn, you can choose to do so with both arms at once, treating them as a two-handed weapon that deals 2d8 damage on a hit.

Curse: Evolved Parasite. If you die while infected with the cordyceps sinensis, the parasite gains more control over your body; if you die three times, you become an NPC under the GM's control, and your goals become aligned with that of Nawre. A GM can devise a way for the host to regain control over their body.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single massive maul.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest Property.

Harvest: Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature's soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.

Transformed: The maul gains the Soul Explosion property.

Soul Explosion: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>The electric sawblade is a viciously effective tool of war that combines the lethality of silver and electricity. The hilt and guard resemble those of a hunter's longsword, often ornately adorned with the markings of the hunter's faction, symbols of the Radiant Church, or grim skulls that embody the dominion over death of the Scions. From this hilt extends the true terror of the weapon: a broad, straight blade constructed from dozens of razor-sharp, silvered teeth arranged in a looped chain. When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease. A powerful generator housed within the hilt infuses the gnashing teeth with crackling energy, adding a galvanizing quality to each cut and rip.

Trick Weapon: This longsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to pull the trigger under the blade to transform and infuse it with electricity for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to stop the current. This weapon regains 1 charge for each 10 minutes that it spends inside a miniature Galespire Coil (often found inside hunter's workshops).
	This silvered longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures not wearing metal armor, as long as the sword has at least 1 charge.

Untransformed: When a melee attack that you can see would hit you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack, adding a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss you and it was made with a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is destroyed by the teeth of the sawblade.

Transformed: The surge of electricity causes the blade to rev faster, requiring both hands to control it. If you use one hand to attack with this sword while it is transformed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it. While transformed, the longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing and 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, the momentum generated from it propels you. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>A sanctified partisan that was reinforced using gravity magic, typically given to high ranking hunters.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gravitational partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.

Untransformed: Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction. On a hit, as part of the attack, you can transform the weapon and a gravity barrier forms in front of you, granting you a +4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

Transformed: This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 2d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced to 0. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage on the check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target's feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>When the manikin of the Sloered abattoir gained sentience, the Scions sent enforcers to quell this threat to Luyarnha's delicate existence. From the abbatoir's meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered-as the manikins named themselves-crafted these versatile weapons. Nicknamed "the meat hook", the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.

Untransformed: While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property. If you hit a creature with the sickle and the blunderbuss on the same turn, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Transformed: When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.

Hookshot: As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, you can detach the hook from the creature and reattach it to the blunderbuss; if you don't, the creature is grappled by you.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.

You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.

Untransformed. After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.

Transformed. This rifle has the Barrel (F) property instead of the Barrel (S) property. Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d8, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.
