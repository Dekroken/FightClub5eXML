        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Scion of Madness (HB)</name>
        <text>The eldritch powers that lurk beyond the veil of the moon have plunged the world into chaos. This chaos is what gives you might; there isn't any form of power more pure nor more potent than this eldritch insanity. You might have endured nightmarish experiments, possibly a higher being has taken an interest in you, or maybe you're a mere pawn in an outer god's scheme. Perhaps you were blessed by powers that shouldn't be, or one of your parents was under an eldritch curse. Whatever the case may be, this insanity consumes you, and will be unleashed on the world, for better or atrociously worse.

        <name>Mind of Madness (Scion of Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, the depraved insanity that lurks within you is always torturing your mind, yet in this chaos you find power. Whenever you gain a madness, you can choose to reroll on the appropriate table, gaining the new effect instead.
	In addition, when a creature attempts to read your thoughts or scry on you, they can only witness the insanity that ravages you. They take psychic damage equal to your level in this class, their magic or ability fails, and they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or gain a short-term madness.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Spread of Chaos (Scion of Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 1st level, you can infuse your magic with your eldritch insanity. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that doesn't have a range of self, you can cause each creature affected by the spell to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or gain a short-term madness.
	If your spell targets more than one creature, you must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the number of creatures targeted by the spell. On a failure, the spell fails and you gain one short-term madness, but you do not expend the spell slot nor the use of this feature. On a success, each creature is affected as normal. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
	Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the GM can have you roll on the Short-Term Madness table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

Short-Term Madness:
When a character is afflicted with short-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness unless specified otherwise.

Short-Term Madness table:

1-10 - Your mind is liberated from any sense of self you may possess:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Without an ego, you are immune to the charmed condition.
3-8 | You mimic the mannerisms, behavior, and speech patterns of the creature closest to you when you gained this madness.
8-10 | Desperate to find yourself again and believing anything, you automatically fail saving throws against being charmed.

11-20 - Your mind is invaded by the sound of the cosmos:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Painful sounds pale in comparison to the cacophony in your head; you are immune to thunder damage.
3-8 | Eldritch utterings scratch your brain; you hear the soft caress of whispers behind your back.
8-10 | The sound of the cosmos drowns out all other noise, closing you to the world. You are deafened and have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration.

21-30 - You have seen too much; your mind can't understand it, causing your sight to become erratic and unreliable:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your vision expands as if you are under the effect of the see invisibility spell.
3-8 | Spectral forms flitter at the corners of your eyes, vanishing when you turn your head.
8-10 | You are blinded, and you can't use any special senses you use to see, such as blindsight or tremorsense.

31-40 - The madness inside you bursts forth as haunting screams:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your scream is so loud that it can cause damage. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can scream at a creature you see within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d12 thunder damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.
3-8 | You can't talk properly; yelling is the only way you can communicate.
8-10 | Your screams are so overwhelming that any creature within 300 feet of you can hear you talk. You also can't form coherent sentences or utter the vocal components of spells.

41-50 - Your posture crumples, as you try to make sense of the insanity before you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You become incredibly skittish. When you are the target of an attack or an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to begin moving evasively, gaining a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.
3-8 | You desperately look for a parental figure that can protect you. Once you find such a person, you latch on to them and refuse to leave their side, no matter what.
8-10 | You fall prone and can't stand, as your legs refuse to obey you, and you can't use any flying speed you possess.

51-60 - You realize that your hands are blasphemous tools:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | These tools can break the minds of your foes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to it.
3-8 | You refuse to use your hands for anything, keeping them hidden from view. If someone stares at them, it makes you extremely uncomfortable and defensive.
8-10 | You shouldn't touch anything. You drop anything you are holding, and can't hold items or grapple creatures.

61-70 - Your body breaks down under the insanity:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You are immune to the poisoned condition.
3-8 | You start emitting a foul smell that is unpleasant even to you, and no amount of washing or magic can remove it.
8-10 | You are poisoned, even if you are immune to the condition.

71-80 - The Eldritch Horrors are revealed to you, bathing you in fear:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | When you gain this madness, each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3-8 | You become paranoid and fearful of any movement or sound.
8-10 | You become frightened of your allies. You must take the Dash action and move away from them by the quickest available route on each of your turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If you start your turn in a location where you can't see any of your allies, you can use your action to end the madness.

81-90 - The madness breaks your mind:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You realize your mind has been holding back your body, and you can now act freely. You have an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
3-8 | You burst into spontaneous fits of laughter randomly, even at the most inappropriate times.
8-10 | You are incapacitated. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to twice your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

91-95 - The revelations from beyond afflict you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body ignores all pain; only the Eldritch Truth matters. You are immune to the stunned condition.
3-8 | You speak to others of the Eldritch Truth in a way that seems limpid to you, but is perhaps not so clear to others. Your sentences are cryptic for the unascended mind.
8-10 | You are stunned. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and attempts to take control:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body releases its animalistic instincts, without the influence of your mind to restrain it. You are under the effect of the haste spell, although it doesn't require concentration. The spell ends when the madness does.
3-8 | Your speech is slurred, as if you're intoxicated, and you punctuate your sentences with animal noises.
8-10 | You fall unconscious, your mind fighting its hardest to not let you become a beast. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

        <name>Depths of Depravity (Scion of Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can let the insanity within you warp the magic of the world. When a creature that you can see within 120 feet of you must make a saving throw, if you are affected by at least one madness, you can use your reaction to add insanity to the magic, giving the creature disadvantage on the saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw, you feed on the ensuing chaos; you regain a sorcery point for each madness affecting you.
	Once you use this feature to regain sorcery points, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>Where madness rots the mind and body of most, it only serves to strengthen you. At 14th level, whenever you roll on a madness table and roll a d10 to determine which specific aspect of the madness overtakes you, you can roll a second d10 and choose the lower result of the two. In addition, gaining a madness doesn't cause you to be stunned.
