    <text>Barrel: 2 (S)

Ammunition: The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

Barrel: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to the number of bullets its barrel can hold (written as Barrel X) before it must be reloaded according to its fast or slow reload property (F or S, respectively).

	• Fast reload: You must use an attack, an action, or a bonus action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

	• Slow reload: You must use an attack or an action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

Blaring: Firing this weapon makes a thunderous crack. The sound can be heard from up to 100 feet away. Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

Spread Fire: A weapon that has the spread fire property can't make a normal attack, instead spraying a cone in front of you with a length equal to its range (for example, a blunderbuss with 'range 20' will fire in a 20- foot cone in front of you). Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take the weapon's normal damage.

Twinned Barrel: This weapon has two barrels that can each hold a bullet and can both be loaded as part of reloading the weapon. You can fire both barrels of a double barrel weapon as part of an attack, instead of each barrel individually. Doing so empties the barrel of the weapon (as per the Barrel property) but increases the damage die of the weapon on a hit (from d4 to d6 to d8 to d10 to d12).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: firearms, blunderbuss

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Artillery. You must use Strength instead of Dexterity for the Firearm save DC and the attack and damage rolls of this weapon. Such a weapon can be fired once before it must be reloaded with an action.

Booming: The deflagration from firing this weapon makes a stupendous booming sound. The sound can be heard from up to 500 feet away. Firing this weapon makes it impossible to go undetected; you automatically fail Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it automatically succeeds on Perception checks against you.

Concussive: These weapons bludgeon as much as they pierce. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning damage. For instance, if a creature is immune to piercing damage and has no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance to all physical damage applies as normal.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

Steady: A weapon with this property can be stabilized for greater accuracy. As a bonus action, you give yourself a bonus to your next attack roll with this weapon this turn equal to your proficiency bonus, and attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during your turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is halved until the end of your turn.

Twinned Barrel: This weapon has two barrels that can each hold a bullet and can both be loaded as part of reloading the weapon. You can fire both barrels of a double barrel weapon as part of an attack, instead of each barrel individually. Doing so empties the barrel of the weapon (as per the Barrel property) but increases the damage die of the weapon on a hit (from d4 to d6 to d8 to d10 to d12).

Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

Fan Fire: You can quickly fire this weapon by slamming the hammer repeatedly. As an action, you fire a number of bullets in a row equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 2, up to the entirety of the barrel). Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -3 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first (such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier, the Sharp-shooter feat, or a magic weapon's bonus to damage rolls). When you use this action, your speed becomes 0 until the end of your turn, and attacks you make using the long range of the weapon automatically miss.
	If you roll a 1 on any of the attack rolls, the weapon jams and can't be used again until it is repaired. You can use an action to make a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, repairing the weapon on a success. Alternatively, you can spend 1 hour outside of combat to mend it, automatically succeeding on the check. If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended in a specialist's store at a quarter of the cost of the firearm.

    <text>Prerequisite: requires a weapon without the spread fire property

On a hit, each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate.

    <text>Prerequisite: requires a weapon with the spread fire property

This bullet ignores the spread fire property and is fired like a standard bullet. On a hit, the target takes your normal weapon damage and the bullet explodes, sending shrapnel flying in a 15-foot cone behind the target. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take damage equal to your weapon damage.

    <text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
