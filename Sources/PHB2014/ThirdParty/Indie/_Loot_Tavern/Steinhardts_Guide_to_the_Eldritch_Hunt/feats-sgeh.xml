    <prerequisite>8th level, Strength 19 or higher</prerequisite>

	• Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• You gain proficiency with cannons.

You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during your turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.

	• You know how to expertly handle cannons and their ammunition; the weight of cannons and cannonballs count as half for you.

	• Your attacks with cannons deal double damage against objects and structures.
