    <description>Parasitic geists are defined by their unnerving appearance and insatiable appetite for living creatures. These once-living beings each met a particularly brutal end, often on nights of the hunt, and were cursed by the city to become voracious apparitions. They have become trapped in a never-ending cycle, feeding on the living in an attempt to regain some semblance of their former selves, but in vain.
	Parasitic geists lost their bodies along with their minds, resembling floating heads with long, writhing tendrils protruding from their ghostly faces. They use these tendrils as a means of feeding, breaking through the skin of unsuspecting victims and draining their life, guided by nothing more than a visceral hunger. The ethereal appearance of these walking corpses is hard to perceive with the naked eye, flickering in and out of existence, phasing through solid structures.
	These monsters are drawn to places where people are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain-grim banquets of blood and agony. Graveyards, battlegrounds, and other locations where death and violence prevail are where they are most often found.

    <description>These dread-filled monstrosities are the harbingers of the Scourge. Uncannily mirroring the appearance of scourgeborne, the fallen Luyarnhians are an abomination born of this dark corruption that began in the Ruby District. Sufficient instincts lingers within them to make them formidable adversaries for the unprepared. They clutch onto torches, a flicker of rationality trying to ward off the encroaching darkness. Yet, this act merely serves to cast long, monstrous shadows, turning the district into a nightmarish landscape.

Some fallen are bloated with bestial energy from their over-exposure to the Scourge. These fallen are distinguishable from others of their kind by their distended and swollen abdomen.

    <description>The corvian dwellers began appearing in the Ruby District, their warped form eerily similar to that of the scourgeborne, like fallen Luyarnhians. Their wings, heavy and matted with grime, are incapable of lifting them high enough to escape the district's confines—a blessing to others, else they'd carry their plague beyond the barricaded borders of the Ruby District.

    <description>Geists are two souls intertwined in a solemn dance of despair and suffering. Created by the will of a Great One, these souls ripped from fallen bodies now do their creator's bidding without judgment or rationale. While their appearance differs from typical ghosts, they too glide through the air with the same eerie motions as their undead brethren. Their form twists and changes, capable of resisting even the blows of magical weapons. Their existence is the reason why most hunters carry plain steel weapons as back up.

Dying Breed. When the moon was shattered, most geists broke along with it. This was the undeniable proof that the hunters had the powers to break and end the Scourge afflicting them. In Luyarnha, death offers no respite; a person's body and soul risk becoming the tortured pawns of vile masters, thus the denizens of the city show a fighting spirit rarely seen elsewhere.

    <description>Enhanced patients are victims of a macabre surgical practice designed to augment their latent psychic abilities. In an ungodly exchange, their natural sight is forever relinquished, alongside most of their intellect, instead replaced by the chilling cold of the Ocular Apparatus. This metal device, fused directly into the patient's eye socket, opens pathways to metaphysical visions beyond comprehension, linking the frail mortal consciousness with something far greater and more terrifying.
	These manipulated individuals, forever blinded to mortal sight, are left suspended in a perpetual state of ethereal revelation, their minds teetering on the brink of cosmic comprehension and madness, bestowing upon them a set of nascent psychic abilities. As living conduits to the cosmos, they form the crux of the Obitus Scholare's ongoing research—the price of their sanity, a small offering for the promise of cosmic enlightenment, holding the key to creating something far greater than meager jaegers.

    <description>Zealots are fanatical followers of the Radiant Church. The Church believes that the Radiant One holds the key to free Luyarnha of its scourge, just as he brought them enlightenment. As such, these zealots do their utmost to spread their message and gather converts. They know that actions speak far louder than words and as such are always at the forefront of each hunt. They are trained in the art of combat, but they prefer to use their abilities to heal and support their allies, strengthening the faith of their comrades through their unwavering devotion. They are often willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their deity, if it means saving their kin.
	Despite their peaceful demeanor, zealots are capable of incredible violence, driven by their faith to defend the Radiant Church and its followers. Although their doctrine is one of tolerance, direct insults to their god are deemed heretical and they will not hesitate to use their powers to quiet the offender. They are often seen leading Radiant Church expeditions, accompanied by a retinue of hunters, as they seek to bring the light back to Luyarnha after its fall from grace.

    <description>Cursed-bloods are brave beyond reason, beings willing to go to dangerous lengths to protect their family;
butchers are part of the many that have sacrificed more than their lives to defend their loved ones.

Lunar Rebirth. For a cursed-blood, removing their mask causes excruciating pain, akin to the agony of being scalped, before causing a horrific death. One dangerous way of acquiring power is for cursed-bloods to, as they approach the end of their life, perform such an act on a night where the Blood Moon is high. All die immediately, their hearts withering; but for a chosen few, a horrific rebirth is granted. Willful subjects to the twisted influence of the astral body, their flesh contorts and mutates in ways that defy the natural order; the lost twin embedded in their chest is resurrected, and its new eye opens to survey the world from within their abominable form. The transformation isn't without cost, as the cursed-blood's mind fractures and its memories fade away, leaving behind only a fierce bloodlust that compels them to slaughter the aberrant.

Eternal Hunt. Now consumed by eldritch power and stripped of their intellect, they are immune to the creeping tendrils of madness that would drive others to insanity. Before their rebirth is complete, an elder of the tribe bestows upon them a red cloth that covers their face, so that the actions from their new body may not tarnish the previous life they led. The newly birthed butcher soon begins their hunt, relentlessly cleaving the beasts that plague the city, though in their mindless zealotry, they often strike down even those that have yet to transform.

    <description>Lining Luyarnha's many churches, one can find silent sentinels of faith: the guardian gargoyles. These constructs, carved from the very stone that forms the walls and balconies of these hallowed places, are more than mere decoration. For the most part, the gargoyles remain as still and silent as the rocks from which they were wrought, standing sentinel over the sacred spaces they protect, their unblinking eyes ever watchful and their monstrous visages a stern warning to those who might dare to defile the sanctity of the church. However, when such sanctity is threatened or the lives of those within its walls are in peril, these seemingly inert creatures are roused to life. Animated with the divine words of the clergy, they move with a singular purpose: to defend the church and its congregation.
	As they spring into action, the stone forms of the gargoyles become supple and agile, their wings unfurling to reveal the full extent of their might, before swooping down upon their enemies with the wrath of the divine. Once their duty is complete, the guardian gargoyles return to their stone slumber, resuming their silent watch over the churches they were birthed to protect.

    <description>The motto of hunters is "survive together, or die together." They never hunt alone, unless they are forced to. After all, even the oft considered greatest hunter, Steinhardt, was always accompanied by Vicar Priscilla on all his hunts. The nights in Luyarnha can be brutal and the beasts relentless, and only a united front can hope to survive.
	All jaegers are hunters, but not all hunters are jaegers. Where jaegers are relentless killers, hunters are often simple citizens wishing to protect their homes and those they love. They are often the first to perish, but fear the one who lives long in a profession where men die young. Hunters are an invaluable contribution to the survival of the city-state and its denizens, and successful hunters cut down hundreds of beasts throughout their life before succumbing to the fires of battle.

    <description>When the hunts first began, they were kept under wraps, only to be executed under cover of the night. Hunters swore an oath of secrecy to the Radiant Church: none were to speak of the Scourge; rumors would spread more virulently than a plague ever could. But the hunters were warriors, not propagandists, and thus the Scions, hungry for favors from the top, offered their help with creating a means of removing any trace of the horrors that occurred each night.

Hunting dogs had been used for centuries in Luyarnha: for retrieving partridges, rounding up wild boar, and even as attack hounds by the city watch. However, all of these canines required a master, and all left the bones and inedible guts of their their prey festering in flycovered mounds. The Radiant Church needed an autonomous creature with fewer dietary scruples, one that would lick the cobbles clean of blood and decayed flesh alike.

Using the technology of manikin creation, the Scions fused flesh to metal, creating a construct-canine with an insatiable appetite: razorblade bitzers. Released in the wake of a hunter's pursuit, or after an eldritch incursion decimates a neighborhood, these bitzers consume all. Bones were broken, liquids lapped up, and the gaze of Luyarnhians is protected from the brutality of the events that transpired the night before.

Although the eldritch runes carved upon the steel of their skin ensures the loyalty of these hounds to the Church, many still roam the streets, forgotten and masterless. Only in death does their duty end.

    <description>With wings that stretch the breadth of a grown man and sharp blades that can rend flesh from bone, a dire fate awaits any who dare cross paths with this warped creature. It is a stalker unparalleled, a being consumed by the very essence of fear that seeks solace in the embrace of darkness. Fortuitously, the denizens of Luyarnha rarely glimpse this monstrosity, for its senses far surpass those of sane mortals, rendering it vulnerable to the raucous cacophony and blinding luminescence of the bustling city-state. Instead, it lurks within the shadowy depths of the forests surrounding the metropolis, biding its time.

Fallen Scourgeborne:
Once a mere vespertilio, this beast has been twisted by madness, its soul devoured by the very darkness it sought refuge within. The vestiges of its humanoid features have been distorted into a grotesque visage, its eyes aglow with a feral hunger as it stalks its quarry. Yet despite its monstrous appearance, the screechwings take to the skies with a grace that belies its savagery, its acute senses guiding it to its prey with lethal precision. Employing its ear-rending shriek, it deafens all who hear, leaving them disoriented and vulnerable to its relentless assault.

    <description>In the moonlit nights of Luyarnha, deformed humanoids loom, their monstrous forms stalking unsuspecting prey, abducting them as test subjects for their masters' heinous rituals and experiments. These wretched beings are called abductors-altered cursed-bloods bound in eternal servitude to the Obitus Scholare.
	Short and gaunt, shrouded in darkened robes, its mouth sewn shut, each abductor carries a candle, an enchanted light that burns its soul to cloak its twisted flesh in shadows. Despite their fragile appearance, abductors possess unparalleled strength, their power enough to subdue even skilled warriors. Rarely do they employ lethal force, preferring to incapacitate their targets before devouring them with the ravenous maw of their conjoined twin, tucking them safely within the confines of their abdomen before delivering them unto their new home.

    <description>On the outskirts of Luyarnha, there once stood a human village, soon to be engulfed by a cruel tragedy of fate, as their village was consumed by a catastrophic wave of corrosive acid, washing over their homes and extinguishing the lives within. The unbearable pain and despair that overtook them in their final moments cracked open the doors of their minds and souls, inviting a curse to take bed within.
	As their mortal forms were twisted and broken by the relentless onslaught of acid, the curse seized upon their anguish, warping their beings into monstrous shapes. In place of the stalwart villagers, there now stood grotesque, undead bears, their singed fur barely concealing the corroded skeletons beneath. The disfiguration they had suffered in their death persisted in these new forms, a macabre testament to the catastrophic demise that had befallen them.
	Now, these cursed beings lurk in the desolate acidic waters that swallowed their village, their anguished spirits consumed by the power that had claimed them. Driven by the lingering rage and despair of their human lives, these bears have become fearsome predators, their presence a warning for any intruder who dare venture into their forsaken homes.

    <description>Will-o'-the-wisps are capricious sprites that delight in misleading the unwary, guiding them from the security of trodden paths and into the perilous embrace of the wilderness. Yet, when forests brim with hatred, a strange phenomenon occurs. This collective animosity converges, taking form into a singular, more potent entity known as a wisp liege, an embodiment of the wisps' evil spirits. After the cataclysm of the First War, such monsters began to dwell within the forests surrounding Luyarnha. It was as if the dark magic unleashed in that conflict had infused the land itself, altering its essence.
	The wisp liege reigns over its lesser kin, its malevolent influence turning their harmless pranks into malefic acts. Under the liege's rule, the wisps' misdirections grow vicious and calculated. No longer are they merely content in leading travelers astray; they now revel in their ensuing demise, echoing the darkness within their sovereign.

    <description>Even though the Obitus's engineering of the jaegers was praised for its scientific brilliance, they quickly discovered that they needed more to slake their insatiable thirst for knowledge. They shifted their attention to canines after observing the amazing advancements the Scions had achieved in developing the Razorblade Bitzers. After all, why couldn't the flesh of mongrels be altered if that of humans, elves, and even manikins could?
	One of the few breeds with the strength to endure exposure to the primordial serum, the same serum which was used to awaken the powers of jaegers, is the Doberman Pinscher. However, like many of the earliest hunters, their bodies were incapable of handling the excess power, irrevocably mangling them.
	Rare are the ones that hunt alongside these 'reviled hounds. In fact, only those who have been trained to see past outward appearances can comprehend that these pups, despite their horrifying features, will remain devoted, even if it means their deaths.

    <description>Failed Experiments:
In their lust for power, the Obitus Scholare lead gruesome experiments, merging the flesh of soldiers with that of eldritch beings. Their labor gave birth to powerful combatants, and a sea of corpses. Scorched adjudicators are the fruits of such experiments, humanoids that couldn't become true warriors, failing to resist the call from beyond and losing their sanity. Yet, the scholars still found a use for these failures: they now act as perfect killers for their creators.

Enforcers of Justice:
Adjudicators enforce justice, more specifically, the brand of justice approved of by the Obitus Scholare. Indeed, these abominations are dispatched to remove any threat to the order, their otherworldly powers trapping the souls of their victims and ensuring an irreversible death. The murderous intent of these monsters is apparent in battle; they delight in causing suffering and their deadly instincts prevents healing. Deriving a twisted sense of pleasure from their hunts, adjudicators often carry the shrunken, decapitated heads of their victims as horrific mementos.

It travels the vast cosmos in search of the one to fill the void within, erring through the stars, for centuries, often in vain. Its whole existence could be considered a cruel cosmic joke. Yet, it does not falter, and its search continues.

Vassals of Gravity:
Its mysterious birth in the cosmos grants an ales nebulae powerful, and sometimes uncontrollable, gravitational powers. The other-worldly bird is able to invert gravity for a brief moment and bend the fabric of reality to teleport around, yet it can't control the crushing field of gravity it emits, preventing all from approaching it. All, but the one it's life was destined for.

    <description>Dullahans owe their dreadful existence to the Circle of Symbiosis. When one of their own members dares to betray the sacred circle, they are condemned to the grim fate of becoming a dullahan. The transgressor is bound to an ancient stone altar, where, beneath the cold gaze of the moon, their head is severed in an act of macabre justice-yet life doesn't leave their body.

Relentless Huntsmen. Unleashed into the world as a headless harbinger, the newly created dullahan is then merged with an undying steed and tasked with a dark purpose: to hunt. Their prey vary—for some, innocent individuals to be kidnapped from their everyday lives, and others, adversaries of the Circle, marked for death. The Circle's knowledge of their targets is eerily accurate, and so, once the dullahan sets its sightless gaze upon a target, relenting isn't an option that exists.

Scorned by Radiance. The price of transmogrification into a dullahan is steep. The unholy essence that fueled their headless form etches an irreversible mark on their soul. Even when restored to their living state, they bear this cursed taint, which stands in stark opposition to the divine energies that brim in many places of worship. When a dullahan dares to breach the boundaries of these hallowed grounds, their bodies immediately ignite in a roaring blaze, punished by the radiant powers above.

Eternal Curse. Should the dullahan weather its gruesome task and pay off the debt of its soul, the Circle takes it upon themselves to decide the creature's destiny. Some are mercifully put to rest, their spectral existences snuffed out as abruptly as they began. Others, who've shown their penitence throughout their servitude, are deemed worthy of a second chance. These fortunate few are restored to their former state, reinstated as druids in the Circle, but forever marked by the scars of their ordeal.

    <description>These nightmarish entities, with an unsettling multitude of writhing limbs producing a continuous, disquieting clatter, are truly a sight to unhinge the mind. Even when seemingly at rest, their bodies appear to be in constant flux, ceaselessly shifting and pulsating in a grotesque dance of flesh and tendons, exuding a noxious miasma—a toxic byproduct of their repugnant feasts.

Nightmare Denizens. Mercifully, the city of Luyarnha has been spared direct contact with these abominations, confined as they are to nightmare realms, unable to breach into the Material Plane. They are grotesque echoes of the absurdity that infests the dreams of the dormant Great Ones. Nightmare centipedes have the ability to ensnare entire communities caught adrift in the nightmare realms, causing them to disappear without trace. Whether these lost souls are consumed or subjected to some other fate is a chilling unknown.

Hive Minds. A single nightmare centipede is sufficiently worrisome, but they become exponentially more dangerous when they gather, forming a collective consciousness. This hive mind amplifies their intellect and their lethality, coordinating their movements and strategies with terrifying efficiency.

Nightmare centipedes produce a subsonic chittering noise, a sound beyond the auditory capabilities of most species, that serves as a communication tool, and as something far viler. They can use this sound to exert control over creatures weaker than themselves, particularly insects and other many-legged beasts, compelling these underlings to enact their gruesome will. Their unfortunate victims can do little more than writhe in agony as a horde of spiders, ants, centipedes, and cockroaches swarm over them, burrowing into their flesh and consuming them from within.

    <description>Skulking shades-grotesque amalgamations of corporeal flesh and shadows—rarely dare to encroach upon the luminous Luyarnha, as if the city's radiance terrifies them. Yet, as the city teeters further and further into the abyss, these nefarious beings have begun to increasingly venture past its walls, particularly in the poorly defended Ruby District, drawn to the banquet of organs innocent mortals offer.

Muddled Origins. Chilling rumors whisper that skulking shades are the progeny of forgotten deities, unleashed upon this reality as punishment for the hubris of mortals who think they can ignore the gods, or even rival them. Other tales tell of these spectral beings as the vestiges of the ancient human empire, neighbors to Luyarnha long ago before its cataclysmic fall, now returning as harbingers of vengeance. Others posit that they are the restless spirits of warriors fallen during the wars, given form anew, eternally thirsting for blood. Whatever the truth may be, dark wielders of death's power have been known to call forth such skulking shades in battle, summoning them from the deepest shadows of this world.

If the creature does so, it can't see the dreadcrow until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dreadcrow in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. Creatures within 5 feet of the dreadcrow have advantage on this saving throw, as they partially see its true form.

    <description>Of all beings that relish in the terror they cause, dreadcrows are among the most foul, embodying the worst fears of those who behold them. A dreadcrow's body is illusory, constantly changing and shifting to reflect its victims' deepest fears. Yet it rarely relies on this, instead opting to lie in wait, slowly eroding the minds of those who are unfortunate enough to cross it, driving them to madness. Victims often lose their grip on reality-and life—long before laying their eyes on a dreadcrow. If approached too closely, dreadcrows will retreat in darkness, snuffing any chance of seeing their true form, before assaulting the mind of their prey and plunging them into a smothering abyss of terror.

    <description>Nightgaunts are nightmarish beings, in the truest sense of the word. Originating from the demented slumber of a Great One, they are its will made manifest. Uncouth black things with smooth, oily, whale-like skin, unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile claws, and tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly. They never speak or laugh, and never smile because they have no faces at all to smile with, only a maddening blankness where a face ought to be.
	Nightgaunts are creatures that subsist on the raw emotions of their prey, lurking in the shadows as their victims writhe in the throes of vicious nightmares. They reveal themselves only when their hunger becomes unbearable, isolating unsuspecting individuals before tormenting them, releasing them only once they've had their fill. Nightgaunts don't take lives, nor inflict grievous physical wounds, unless attacked first. However, the mental scars they wreak are hard to heal, leaving many of their victims with bouts of insomnia and a fear of the dark that can last for a lifetime.

    <description>Before the Scourge, before even the First War, the hubris of wizards invited the eldritch powers to assert their will. These osteomancers, magicians who delve into the magic of bones, sought to enhance their own bodies-growing to the heights of giants, making armour of bony plates, and forming blades from calcified protrusions. Like moths to a flame, eldritch beings were drawn to these spellcasters and corrupted their magic, resulting in the malformed creatures known as cloistered maidens.

Sexual Dimorphism:
Over a few days, a period known as the Great Unchaining, all who practiced osteomancy lost control of their spells. All male osteomancers began dying, their bones growing in warped, fractal patterns and piercing their own organs. Their female counterparts fared even worse: borne by a flood of necromantic magic, their bodies grew into large, twisted creatures, vessels for the eldritch powers that overcame them.

Eternal Hunger:
These half-dead corpses feel nothing more than an insatiable hunger that drives them to devour anything alive. Indeed, reports of a cloistered maiden are often the first priority for hunters lest they turn entire neighbourhoods into corpse and bone. The Radiant Church, ever vocal in its disparagement of osteomancy, proclaims these maidens to be manifestations of the sin of gluttony, another instrument in the toolbox of propaganda they use to sway the populace.

    <description>Deep within the subterranean depths of the Asylum, a network of chambers houses a once-proud race of giants, now transformed into grotesque monstrosities through years of barbaric experimentation.

Prisoners of War. The First War saw Luyarnha pitted against its expansionist enemies, driving the city-state to abandon all moral principles in its quest for means to combat the rampant scourge that threatened its citizens. The early scholars of death, dogged in their determination, pressed forward with their grotesque experiments, and in their desperate pursuit of the perfect hunter, recognized the frailty of the humanoid body. They turned to capturing and subduing giants for their grim work-beings that could withstand more suffering before death.

Derelict Patients. To ensure the subjects' cooperation and restrict their movements during harrowing procedures, the giants were chained with bonds that burrowed deep into their very bones. Heavy armor was then affixed to their twisted forms, before injecting them with refined cerebro-spinal fluid extracted from Otherworldly beings, twisting their bodies and shattering their minds. Their usefulness was eventually outlived, as the scholars, now enlightened, resumed their experiments on humanoids. With the giants' blood now corrosive and their minds destroyed, they remain imprisoned in their bleak chambers, abandoned, condemned to pain and insanity until their eventual death, forgotten by all.

These tireless inquisitors have undergone a gruesome transmutation, rendering them immune to the corrupting magic of these blasphemous wizards.
	In a secret rite known only in the highest echelons of the Grey Templars, the bones of these chosen few are meticulously removed and replaced with an advanced composite, bestowed by the Scions and transmuted into a divine element through days of fervent prayers and blessings. This miraculous metamorphosis imbues the Hollow Sentinels with unparalleled resilience, enabling them to ignore even the most potent osteomantic spells.
	The process of becoming a Hollow Sentinel is not without risk, and only the most devoted and resolute candidates are chosen to undergo the transformation. The loss of their innate skeletal framework is an excruciating ordeal; nevertheless, the Sentinels maintain that there is no nobler sacrifice than the ones they render in the name of their righteous duty. Albeit, the toll exacted for the attainment of such might is a remarkably slow recovery-borne from the partial loss of their humanity-oftentimes necessitating days to heal from a single mission, thereby constraining the church's capacity to deploy these invaluable combatants.

A bleeding creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, after taking the damage, ending the effect on a success. The DC equals 15 + half the number of dice of damage remaining (rounded down).

    <description>The jaegers of Luyarnha stand as the city's premier line of defense, a formidable force whose might singlehandedly turned the tides of battle in the First War. These warriors exhibit an unwavering commitment to their city, always the first to answer the call of duty and often the last thing their adversaries see. In their hands, the jaegers wield potent trick weapons gifted to them by the Church and other factions dedicated to the city's salvation. With these instruments of destruction, they can decimate entire squadrons of beasts and humanoids, nimbly evading attacks and relentlessly pursuing their quarries until their blades sink into their targets.
	The mysterious process of their creation is closely guarded by their creators, the enigmatic Obitus Scholare. With the ongoing city lockdown, however, the ranks of the jaegers have been gradually thinning. They fall in battle more rapidly than new jaegers can be forged. It is the hope of all citizens that Luyarnha can stem the tide of the Scourge before their mightiest shield shatters.
	Every jaeger's life revolves around a strict regimen of training and battle, honing their skills and reflexes beyond the potential of mere mortals: with each kill, they sharpen their instincts, bolstering their own strength and becoming harder to kill-an unfortunate truth that applies even to those of them who lose their sanity. Jaegers are the city's greatest hope and the embodiment of its deepest fear-the jaegers, ever the hunters, ever the hunted.

    <description>The inexplicable feeling of fear that grips the heart and wrenches the gut is not a rare occurrence in Luyarnha.
Most citizens blame that fear on the horrors that lurk in the streets at night, but some of the town's most deranged denizens accuse an unseen force: skeletal behemoths that lie in wait atop the spires of the city, and alongside its walls.

Silent Watchers:
Lunar revenants move unseen, their form only revealed by the light of the moon, dwelling in locales where the stench of death permeates the very air they breathe. Hence, it comes as no surprise that so many are drawn to Luyarnha and its murderous madness. These eerie creatures do not make a sound, even upon death, they simply vanish, leaving behind naught but a thin trail of ash, the sole memento of their existence.

Peaceful Brutality:
Although they never initiate a battle, once provoked, Lunar revenants become brutal engines of death, relentlessly attacking until their opponents lie shattered, before returning to their idle occupations, as if the fight was but a mere bad dream. Few hunters can testify to their ruthlessness, as few ever made it out alive. The first attack against a lunar revenant was ordered by the Radiant Church, in a misguided attempt to quell the tale of their existence. That night, dozens of hunters perished to bring down a single revenant, a sacrifice none were ready to pay. Thereafter, it was decided that these beings were best left well alone; after all, it is much easier to silence those who would spread rumors.

    <description>The advent of the First War brought forth unanticipated terrors from the southern reaches, among them were the roaring manes, elemental lions that can tunnel through earth and explode onto the battlefield with deafening roars that unnerve even the most seasoned warriors. The precise method employed by the southern armies to tame these fierce beasts remains a mystery, with captured soldiers cryptically alluding to sharing a bond of blood.
	These beasts, once capable of burrowing beneath the Luyarnha's primitive walls, never could penetrate stone nor steel. Ironically, the menace they once posed bolstered the city's defenses, providing employment opportunities for the cursed-bloods, who went on to strengthen not only the city walls but also the city's infrastructure. This construction effort thwarted roaring manes, the reinforced ramparts now more profound and impervious—a fortified blend that would serve to break their claws.
	In the era before ramparts and the Scions' mastery over lightning and thunder, roaring manes were a dreadful omen on the battlefield. However, today, with the resolution of the First War, the echoes of the roaring manes' destructive past have vanished and the few that remain are held in captivity, serving as amusement for the city's nobility in their combat arenas.

    <description>Creations of the Scions, blue-flame custodians are instrumental tools of the eldritch hunt, as their azure flames reveal even those who lurk beyond. Though their minds are engineered to be unbreakable, their swords often fail under the tremendous force of their blows. The cerulean fire that powers them is manufactured by exposing flames to Scionic lightning, a practice that some in their ranks call blasphemous.
	A custodian's sturdy body is used as a shield in the midst of battle, defending the intellectual and frail scientists that are the Scions—a shield that must be held separate from one's body. Indeed, some have tried to create armor from the body of custodians; all were immolated by the azure flames.
	In the aftermath of the first hunts, the production of blue-flame custodians came to a halt, as the rare metals required for their construction disappeared, along with entire trade routes, when Luyarnha was cut off from the world. Now, what remains of these living suits of armor is fiercely protected by the Scions, and their bodies are always sought after, should they fall in battle.

    <description>The cervus tenebris, spectral beings adorned with massive sets of ghostly wings, prowl the shadows in search of their next unsuspecting victim. Once humanoid, they were driven by an insatiable hunger so monstrous that they succumbed to the unthinkable act of cannibalism. In the throes of their grisly feast, they consumed their own bodies, an abomination that should have led to their demise. But the cosmos had other plans. Instead of meeting their end, they underwent a heinous transformation, becoming monstrous beings shrouded in shadows and damned to a never-ending existence of torment.

Only while it hunts does the gnawing pain that crucifies its body dulls-it lives in a constant state of agony. This torment it externalizes unto its victims, summoning shadows from the fallen to stalk and drain the life from its quarries, weakening them for an inevitable, gruesome death. The cervus tenebris hunts by consuming the flesh and shadows of the living, growing more formidable as it feasts upon the essence of its prey, its spectral wings expanding as it gorges itself upon the life of its victims.

    <description>The emergence of such a formidable monster as this breed of belua is a rare and dreaded event. Most beluas succumb to their curse and transform into lesser monstrosities, such as the Scourge Lycans, which though still dangerous, don't possess the same unfathomable savagery as their greater kin. However, should a particularly skilled hunter lose their grip on their own humanity, they may become a far greater menace to the city than any mere beast they had once vanquished.
	The devouring belua is a fearsome monstrosity birthed from the unbridled fury of an eponymous scourgeborne, a monster that bears witness to the brutal nature of their curse. Once half-beasts of lupine visage, with a tenuous hold on their souls, they are now consumed by the inferno of their own anger, and have surrendered entirely to their bestial essence, abandoning any semblance of morality. The devouring belua's lupine form has completely overtaken their humanoid shape; their once unblemished skin now a mangled tangle of coarse, matted hair; their muzzles elongated, filled with razor-sharp teeth that rend flesh with vicious ease; and their howls, harrowing echoes of their suffering, are now cacophonous cries that freeze the blood of those who hear them.
	Once turned, these monsters prowl the shadowed alleyways and desolate corners of Luyarnha, their blind anger robbing them of their sight, like a cruel poetry of fate. Relying solely on their heightened senses of hearing and smell to navigate the world around them, their blindness now only serves as a catalyst for their rage, ensuring that anyone—beast or huma—who crosses their path will be met with a storm of ferocity.
	It is whispered that devouring belua are capable of detecting the rage that lies dormant in the hearts of others, drawn to the turmoil that festers within. They prey upon these enraged souls, devouring the very essence of their anger, leaving behind a broken husk, devoid of fury or flesh, whilst feeding their own insatiable anger in vain.

With the head of an owl, the body of a bear, and the scales of a serpent, it moves with an unnatural, fluid grace, as if its bones were made of rubber rather than calcium. Its matted fur is a patchwork of grays and browns, covered in a sickly sheen of slime and sweat, and its twisted tentacles are incapable of swimming, instead serving as a mockery of the octopus form.
	The neck of an owlbear is the most unsettling aspect of its monstrous form. Adorned with a swirling mass of fleshy fangs, its neck is a kaleidoscope of madness that seems to shift and writhe of its own accord. As an owlbear approaches, the stench of decay and corruption precedes it, filling the air with a noxious cloud of rot and filth. Its jaws, lined with razor-sharp teeth, click and snap with a rhythmic hunger that speaks of its insatiable appetite for flesh. Its claws, long and curved like sickles, are stained with the blood of countless victims, and its very presence seems to warp reality around it, plunging the world into a nightmare of darkness and chaos where light will be snuffed out.

If the penitent hits the target with a greatsword attack before the end of its turn, the limb is cut clean (see 'Losing Limbs', page 309 of SGttEH). The penitent then adds the limb to its crucible.</text>

      <text>The penitent magically attaches one of the limbs in its crucible to itself or a willing creature within its reach if that creature is missing the limb. The limb is fully functional, and the creature regains any abilities it lost due to the limb being severed. The penitent starts with 1d4 limbs in its crucible.</text>

      <text>When a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of the penitent, or enters the area for the first time on a turn, the penitent can entrap it in its crucible. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be trapped in the crucible. While trapped, the target is restrained, has total cover against effects outside the crucible, and takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of the penitent's turns. A trapped creature, or an ally within reach, can use its action to make a DC 19 Athletics check, toppling the crucible and freeing the creature on a success.
	If toppled, the crucible magically teleports onto the back of the penitent at the end of its next turn. Alternatively, the penitent can recall it as a bonus action. While not carrying the crucible, the penitent can't use its Hands of Punishment, Limb Offering, or Reattach Limb actions.</text>

    <description>Librarian Kristoffs Journal Entry #32 - The Penitent

This plane does not birth them, yet they feast on the limbs of its denizens. Could they be aberrations born from the Scourge's corruption upon our citizenry? I find it improbable, given their uniform golden masks - an oddity unlikely from simple mutation. Perhaps remnants of church weaponry of the First War?
	That too seems a stretch. The sacred tomes affixed to their sides bear no resemblance to any religious texts I have encountered. An important piece of the puzzle that deepens the mystery surrounding them.
	One particularly unsettling observation - they possess a capability akin to 'reproduction.' Yet, instead of a natural birthing process, they seem to corrupt other beings into their likeness, each new convert subsequently donning a similar golden mask.
	They abhor sunlight and shun noise, fleeing from both like beasts before a flame. This would explain why they rarely appear above the surface. My studies lead me to speculate on the existence of an overarching hive mind, a singular consciousness puppeteering these drones.

    <description>A chimeric creation of beasts and bones, galvanized prowlers were once the epitome of Scion technology, a defensive bastion against the Scourge's onslaught. Corrupted by the eldritch components from which they were crafted, they slaughtered their masters and joined the ranks of those they once hunted.

Storm Hunter. Leaping between rooftops, galvaznied prowlers are as avid storm chasers as they are predators; they revel in the refreshing tickle of a lightning strike on their skin and use a tempest's rolling thunder as cover to mask the sound of their pursuit. The howl of a prowler is distinctive, an ear-scrambling cacophony of taut wire scraping over rusted bones. To hear such a noise is a clear warning to remain indoors, with doors barred and windows shuttered, lest it is death you seek.

Origin. In their efforts to build an arsenal of creatures with which to defend Luyarnha, the Scions explored the magic of chimerification. With threads of tin, these scientists stitched components harvested from eldritch corpses to the bodies of criminals and, with a burst of lightning, fused the rotting mass into a weak-willed and easily manipulable creature. But their weak will and eldritch blood made them susceptible to the influence of the Great Ones, who soon found new foot soldiers to add to their chaotic horde.

    <description>In the forlorn Luyarnha, where clerics and hunters hold sway, magic capable of resurrecting the fallen is often called "The Call of Death." For those who have journeyed beyond the veil of mortality and dare return, an irremovable stain is left on their soul, beckoning their demise — "Death".
	A monster that stalks those who have eluded the clutches of the grave, a creature whose sole purpose is to snuff out the lives of those who have defied their fate, Death's reputation is such that its mere mention is enough to send shivers down the spines of those afflicted.
	No one knows for certain where Death came from or why it was unleashed upon the world, but its presence is a grim reminder of the fragility of life. Yet there are those who seek to defy this fate, who cling to life with a desperate fervor, willing to pay any price to cheat its relentless march, those who would think themselves above their kin, but to Death, their life has the same worth as that of a beggar's-two gold coins, which shall cover their eyes until it finds its next prey.
