    <description>Parasitic geists are defined by their unnerving appearance and insatiable appetite for living creatures. These once-living beings each met a particularly brutal end, often on nights of the hunt, and were cursed by the city to become voracious apparitions. They have become trapped in a never-ending cycle, feeding on the living in an attempt to regain some semblance of their former selves, but in vain.
	Parasitic geists lost their bodies along with their minds, resembling floating heads with long, writhing tendrils protruding from their ghostly faces. They use these tendrils as a means of feeding, breaking through the skin of unsuspecting victims and draining their life, guided by nothing more than a visceral hunger. The ethereal appearance of these walking corpses is hard to perceive with the naked eye, flickering in and out of existence, phasing through solid structures.
	These monsters are drawn to places where people are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain-grim banquets of blood and agony. Graveyards, battlegrounds, and other locations where death and violence prevail are where they are most often found.

    <description>These dread-filled monstrosities are the harbingers of the Scourge. Uncannily mirroring the appearance of scourgeborne, the fallen Luyarnhians are an abomination born of this dark corruption that began in the Ruby District. Sufficient instincts lingers within them to make them formidable adversaries for the unprepared. They clutch onto torches, a flicker of rationality trying to ward off the encroaching darkness. Yet, this act merely serves to cast long, monstrous shadows, turning the district into a nightmarish landscape.

Some fallen are bloated with bestial energy from their over-exposure to the Scourge. These fallen are distinguishable from others of their kind by their distended and swollen abdomen.

    <description>The corvian dwellers began appearing in the Ruby District, their warped form eerily similar to that of the scourgeborne, like fallen Luyarnhians. Their wings, heavy and matted with grime, are incapable of lifting them high enough to escape the district's confines—a blessing to others, else they'd carry their plague beyond the barricaded borders of the Ruby District.

    <description>Geists are two souls intertwined in a solemn dance of despair and suffering. Created by the will of a Great One, these souls ripped from fallen bodies now do their creator's bidding without judgment or rationale. While their appearance differs from typical ghosts, they too glide through the air with the same eerie motions as their undead brethren. Their form twists and changes, capable of resisting even the blows of magical weapons. Their existence is the reason why most hunters carry plain steel weapons as back up.

Dying Breed. When the moon was shattered, most geists broke along with it. This was the undeniable proof that the hunters had the powers to break and end the Scourge afflicting them. In Luyarnha, death offers no respite; a person's body and soul risk becoming the tortured pawns of vile masters, thus the denizens of the city show a fighting spirit rarely seen elsewhere.

    <description>Enhanced patients are victims of a macabre surgical practice designed to augment their latent psychic abilities. In an ungodly exchange, their natural sight is forever relinquished, alongside most of their intellect, instead replaced by the chilling cold of the Ocular Apparatus. This metal device, fused directly into the patient's eye socket, opens pathways to metaphysical visions beyond comprehension, linking the frail mortal consciousness with something far greater and more terrifying.
	These manipulated individuals, forever blinded to mortal sight, are left suspended in a perpetual state of ethereal revelation, their minds teetering on the brink of cosmic comprehension and madness, bestowing upon them a set of nascent psychic abilities. As living conduits to the cosmos, they form the crux of the Obitus Scholare's ongoing research—the price of their sanity, a small offering for the promise of cosmic enlightenment, holding the key to creating something far greater than meager jaegers.

    <description>Zealots are fanatical followers of the Radiant Church. The Church believes that the Radiant One holds the key to free Luyarnha of its scourge, just as he brought them enlightenment. As such, these zealots do their utmost to spread their message and gather converts. They know that actions speak far louder than words and as such are always at the forefront of each hunt. They are trained in the art of combat, but they prefer to use their abilities to heal and support their allies, strengthening the faith of their comrades through their unwavering devotion. They are often willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their deity, if it means saving their kin.
	Despite their peaceful demeanor, zealots are capable of incredible violence, driven by their faith to defend the Radiant Church and its followers. Although their doctrine is one of tolerance, direct insults to their god are deemed heretical and they will not hesitate to use their powers to quiet the offender. They are often seen leading Radiant Church expeditions, accompanied by a retinue of hunters, as they seek to bring the light back to Luyarnha after its fall from grace.

    <description>Cursed-bloods are brave beyond reason, beings willing to go to dangerous lengths to protect their family;
butchers are part of the many that have sacrificed more than their lives to defend their loved ones.

Lunar Rebirth. For a cursed-blood, removing their mask causes excruciating pain, akin to the agony of being scalped, before causing a horrific death. One dangerous way of acquiring power is for cursed-bloods to, as they approach the end of their life, perform such an act on a night where the Blood Moon is high. All die immediately, their hearts withering; but for a chosen few, a horrific rebirth is granted. Willful subjects to the twisted influence of the astral body, their flesh contorts and mutates in ways that defy the natural order; the lost twin embedded in their chest is resurrected, and its new eye opens to survey the world from within their abominable form. The transformation isn't without cost, as the cursed-blood's mind fractures and its memories fade away, leaving behind only a fierce bloodlust that compels them to slaughter the aberrant.

Eternal Hunt. Now consumed by eldritch power and stripped of their intellect, they are immune to the creeping tendrils of madness that would drive others to insanity. Before their rebirth is complete, an elder of the tribe bestows upon them a red cloth that covers their face, so that the actions from their new body may not tarnish the previous life they led. The newly birthed butcher soon begins their hunt, relentlessly cleaving the beasts that plague the city, though in their mindless zealotry, they often strike down even those that have yet to transform.

    <description>Lining Luyarnha's many churches, one can find silent sentinels of faith: the guardian gargoyles. These constructs, carved from the very stone that forms the walls and balconies of these hallowed places, are more than mere decoration. For the most part, the gargoyles remain as still and silent as the rocks from which they were wrought, standing sentinel over the sacred spaces they protect, their unblinking eyes ever watchful and their monstrous visages a stern warning to those who might dare to defile the sanctity of the church. However, when such sanctity is threatened or the lives of those within its walls are in peril, these seemingly inert creatures are roused to life. Animated with the divine words of the clergy, they move with a singular purpose: to defend the church and its congregation.
	As they spring into action, the stone forms of the gargoyles become supple and agile, their wings unfurling to reveal the full extent of their might, before swooping down upon their enemies with the wrath of the divine. Once their duty is complete, the guardian gargoyles return to their stone slumber, resuming their silent watch over the churches they were birthed to protect.

    <description>The motto of hunters is "survive together, or die together." They never hunt alone, unless they are forced to. After all, even the oft considered greatest hunter, Steinhardt, was always accompanied by Vicar Priscilla on all his hunts. The nights in Luyarnha can be brutal and the beasts relentless, and only a united front can hope to survive.
	All jaegers are hunters, but not all hunters are jaegers. Where jaegers are relentless killers, hunters are often simple citizens wishing to protect their homes and those they love. They are often the first to perish, but fear the one who lives long in a profession where men die young. Hunters are an invaluable contribution to the survival of the city-state and its denizens, and successful hunters cut down hundreds of beasts throughout their life before succumbing to the fires of battle.

    <description>When the hunts first began, they were kept under wraps, only to be executed under cover of the night. Hunters swore an oath of secrecy to the Radiant Church: none were to speak of the Scourge; rumors would spread more virulently than a plague ever could. But the hunters were warriors, not propagandists, and thus the Scions, hungry for favors from the top, offered their help with creating a means of removing any trace of the horrors that occurred each night.

Hunting dogs had been used for centuries in Luyarnha: for retrieving partridges, rounding up wild boar, and even as attack hounds by the city watch. However, all of these canines required a master, and all left the bones and inedible guts of their their prey festering in flycovered mounds. The Radiant Church needed an autonomous creature with fewer dietary scruples, one that would lick the cobbles clean of blood and decayed flesh alike.

Using the technology of manikin creation, the Scions fused flesh to metal, creating a construct-canine with an insatiable appetite: razorblade bitzers. Released in the wake of a hunter's pursuit, or after an eldritch incursion decimates a neighborhood, these bitzers consume all. Bones were broken, liquids lapped up, and the gaze of Luyarnhians is protected from the brutality of the events that transpired the night before.

Although the eldritch runes carved upon the steel of their skin ensures the loyalty of these hounds to the Church, many still roam the streets, forgotten and masterless. Only in death does their duty end.

    <description>With wings that stretch the breadth of a grown man and sharp blades that can rend flesh from bone, a dire fate awaits any who dare cross paths with this warped creature. It is a stalker unparalleled, a being consumed by the very essence of fear that seeks solace in the embrace of darkness. Fortuitously, the denizens of Luyarnha rarely glimpse this monstrosity, for its senses far surpass those of sane mortals, rendering it vulnerable to the raucous cacophony and blinding luminescence of the bustling city-state. Instead, it lurks within the shadowy depths of the forests surrounding the metropolis, biding its time.

Fallen Scourgeborne:
Once a mere vespertilio, this beast has been twisted by madness, its soul devoured by the very darkness it sought refuge within. The vestiges of its humanoid features have been distorted into a grotesque visage, its eyes aglow with a feral hunger as it stalks its quarry. Yet despite its monstrous appearance, the screechwings take to the skies with a grace that belies its savagery, its acute senses guiding it to its prey with lethal precision. Employing its ear-rending shriek, it deafens all who hear, leaving them disoriented and vulnerable to its relentless assault.

    <description>In the moonlit nights of Luyarnha, deformed humanoids loom, their monstrous forms stalking unsuspecting prey, abducting them as test subjects for their masters' heinous rituals and experiments. These wretched beings are called abductors-altered cursed-bloods bound in eternal servitude to the Obitus Scholare.
	Short and gaunt, shrouded in darkened robes, its mouth sewn shut, each abductor carries a candle, an enchanted light that burns its soul to cloak its twisted flesh in shadows. Despite their fragile appearance, abductors possess unparalleled strength, their power enough to subdue even skilled warriors. Rarely do they employ lethal force, preferring to incapacitate their targets before devouring them with the ravenous maw of their conjoined twin, tucking them safely within the confines of their abdomen before delivering them unto their new home.

    <description>On the outskirts of Luyarnha, there once stood a human village, soon to be engulfed by a cruel tragedy of fate, as their village was consumed by a catastrophic wave of corrosive acid, washing over their homes and extinguishing the lives within. The unbearable pain and despair that overtook them in their final moments cracked open the doors of their minds and souls, inviting a curse to take bed within.
	As their mortal forms were twisted and broken by the relentless onslaught of acid, the curse seized upon their anguish, warping their beings into monstrous shapes. In place of the stalwart villagers, there now stood grotesque, undead bears, their singed fur barely concealing the corroded skeletons beneath. The disfiguration they had suffered in their death persisted in these new forms, a macabre testament to the catastrophic demise that had befallen them.
	Now, these cursed beings lurk in the desolate acidic waters that swallowed their village, their anguished spirits consumed by the power that had claimed them. Driven by the lingering rage and despair of their human lives, these bears have become fearsome predators, their presence a warning for any intruder who dare venture into their forsaken homes.

    <description>Will-o'-the-wisps are capricious sprites that delight in misleading the unwary, guiding them from the security of trodden paths and into the perilous embrace of the wilderness. Yet, when forests brim with hatred, a strange phenomenon occurs. This collective animosity converges, taking form into a singular, more potent entity known as a wisp liege, an embodiment of the wisps' evil spirits. After the cataclysm of the First War, such monsters began to dwell within the forests surrounding Luyarnha. It was as if the dark magic unleashed in that conflict had infused the land itself, altering its essence.
	The wisp liege reigns over its lesser kin, its malevolent influence turning their harmless pranks into malefic acts. Under the liege's rule, the wisps' misdirections grow vicious and calculated. No longer are they merely content in leading travelers astray; they now revel in their ensuing demise, echoing the darkness within their sovereign.

    <description>Even though the Obitus's engineering of the jaegers was praised for its scientific brilliance, they quickly discovered that they needed more to slake their insatiable thirst for knowledge. They shifted their attention to canines after observing the amazing advancements the Scions had achieved in developing the Razorblade Bitzers. After all, why couldn't the flesh of mongrels be altered if that of humans, elves, and even manikins could?
	One of the few breeds with the strength to endure exposure to the primordial serum, the same serum which was used to awaken the powers of jaegers, is the Doberman Pinscher. However, like many of the earliest hunters, their bodies were incapable of handling the excess power, irrevocably mangling them.
	Rare are the ones that hunt alongside these 'reviled hounds. In fact, only those who have been trained to see past outward appearances can comprehend that these pups, despite their horrifying features, will remain devoted, even if it means their deaths.

    <description>Failed Experiments:
In their lust for power, the Obitus Scholare lead gruesome experiments, merging the flesh of soldiers with that of eldritch beings. Their labor gave birth to powerful combatants, and a sea of corpses. Scorched adjudicators are the fruits of such experiments, humanoids that couldn't become true warriors, failing to resist the call from beyond and losing their sanity. Yet, the scholars still found a use for these failures: they now act as perfect killers for their creators.

Enforcers of Justice:
Adjudicators enforce justice, more specifically, the brand of justice approved of by the Obitus Scholare. Indeed, these abominations are dispatched to remove any threat to the order, their otherworldly powers trapping the souls of their victims and ensuring an irreversible death. The murderous intent of these monsters is apparent in battle; they delight in causing suffering and their deadly instincts prevents healing. Deriving a twisted sense of pleasure from their hunts, adjudicators often carry the shrunken, decapitated heads of their victims as horrific mementos.

It travels the vast cosmos in search of the one to fill the void within, erring through the stars, for centuries, often in vain. Its whole existence could be considered a cruel cosmic joke. Yet, it does not falter, and its search continues.

Vassals of Gravity:
Its mysterious birth in the cosmos grants an ales nebulae powerful, and sometimes uncontrollable, gravitational powers. The other-worldly bird is able to invert gravity for a brief moment and bend the fabric of reality to teleport around, yet it can't control the crushing field of gravity it emits, preventing all from approaching it. All, but the one it's life was destined for.

    <description>Dullahans owe their dreadful existence to the Circle of Symbiosis. When one of their own members dares to betray the sacred circle, they are condemned to the grim fate of becoming a dullahan. The transgressor is bound to an ancient stone altar, where, beneath the cold gaze of the moon, their head is severed in an act of macabre justice-yet life doesn't leave their body.

Relentless Huntsmen. Unleashed into the world as a headless harbinger, the newly created dullahan is then merged with an undying steed and tasked with a dark purpose: to hunt. Their prey vary—for some, innocent individuals to be kidnapped from their everyday lives, and others, adversaries of the Circle, marked for death. The Circle's knowledge of their targets is eerily accurate, and so, once the dullahan sets its sightless gaze upon a target, relenting isn't an option that exists.

Scorned by Radiance. The price of transmogrification into a dullahan is steep. The unholy essence that fueled their headless form etches an irreversible mark on their soul. Even when restored to their living state, they bear this cursed taint, which stands in stark opposition to the divine energies that brim in many places of worship. When a dullahan dares to breach the boundaries of these hallowed grounds, their bodies immediately ignite in a roaring blaze, punished by the radiant powers above.

Eternal Curse. Should the dullahan weather its gruesome task and pay off the debt of its soul, the Circle takes it upon themselves to decide the creature's destiny. Some are mercifully put to rest, their spectral existences snuffed out as abruptly as they began. Others, who've shown their penitence throughout their servitude, are deemed worthy of a second chance. These fortunate few are restored to their former state, reinstated as druids in the Circle, but forever marked by the scars of their ordeal.

    <description>These nightmarish entities, with an unsettling multitude of writhing limbs producing a continuous, disquieting clatter, are truly a sight to unhinge the mind. Even when seemingly at rest, their bodies appear to be in constant flux, ceaselessly shifting and pulsating in a grotesque dance of flesh and tendons, exuding a noxious miasma—a toxic byproduct of their repugnant feasts.

Nightmare Denizens. Mercifully, the city of Luyarnha has been spared direct contact with these abominations, confined as they are to nightmare realms, unable to breach into the Material Plane. They are grotesque echoes of the absurdity that infests the dreams of the dormant Great Ones. Nightmare centipedes have the ability to ensnare entire communities caught adrift in the nightmare realms, causing them to disappear without trace. Whether these lost souls are consumed or subjected to some other fate is a chilling unknown.

Hive Minds. A single nightmare centipede is sufficiently worrisome, but they become exponentially more dangerous when they gather, forming a collective consciousness. This hive mind amplifies their intellect and their lethality, coordinating their movements and strategies with terrifying efficiency.

Nightmare centipedes produce a subsonic chittering noise, a sound beyond the auditory capabilities of most species, that serves as a communication tool, and as something far viler. They can use this sound to exert control over creatures weaker than themselves, particularly insects and other many-legged beasts, compelling these underlings to enact their gruesome will. Their unfortunate victims can do little more than writhe in agony as a horde of spiders, ants, centipedes, and cockroaches swarm over them, burrowing into their flesh and consuming them from within.

    <description>Skulking shades-grotesque amalgamations of corporeal flesh and shadows—rarely dare to encroach upon the luminous Luyarnha, as if the city's radiance terrifies them. Yet, as the city teeters further and further into the abyss, these nefarious beings have begun to increasingly venture past its walls, particularly in the poorly defended Ruby District, drawn to the banquet of organs innocent mortals offer.

Muddled Origins. Chilling rumors whisper that skulking shades are the progeny of forgotten deities, unleashed upon this reality as punishment for the hubris of mortals who think they can ignore the gods, or even rival them. Other tales tell of these spectral beings as the vestiges of the ancient human empire, neighbors to Luyarnha long ago before its cataclysmic fall, now returning as harbingers of vengeance. Others posit that they are the restless spirits of warriors fallen during the wars, given form anew, eternally thirsting for blood. Whatever the truth may be, dark wielders of death's power have been known to call forth such skulking shades in battle, summoning them from the deepest shadows of this world.

If the creature does so, it can't see the dreadcrow until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dreadcrow in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. Creatures within 5 feet of the dreadcrow have advantage on this saving throw, as they partially see its true form.

      <text>The dreadcrow creates atrocious illusions that rend sanity. Each creature within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness and become frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This action doesn't reveal the dreadcrow if it's hidden.</text>

      <name>Living Nightmare (Recharges after a Long Rest)</name>
      <recharge>LONG</recharge>
      <text>The dreadcrow becomes the embodiment of terror for a creature that is frightened of it within 60 feet of it. This unleashes a primal tear within the target, causing the target to go insane. It must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a tailed save, the target bellows a scream so powertul that it rips its own vocal cords and it loses the ability to speak. If the target is still frightened of the dreadcrow at the start of the dreadcrow's next turn and the target can see the dreadcrow, the terror becomes so untenable that it rips out its own eyes, becoming blinded.</text>

      <text>The dreadcrow forces a creature that it can see within 30 feet to look at it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom check or look directly at the Dreadcrow.</text>

    <description>Of all beings that relish in the terror they cause, dreadcrows are among the most foul, embodying the worst fears of those who behold them. A dreadcrow's body is illusory, constantly changing and shifting to reflect its victims' deepest fears. Yet it rarely relies on this, instead opting to lie in wait, slowly eroding the minds of those who are unfortunate enough to cross it, driving them to madness. Victims often lose their grip on reality-and life—long before laying their eyes on a dreadcrow. If approached too closely, dreadcrows will retreat in darkness, snuffing any chance of seeing their true form, before assaulting the mind of their prey and plunging them into a smothering abyss of terror.
