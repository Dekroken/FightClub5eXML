    <description>Parasitic geists are defined by their unnerving appearance and insatiable appetite for living creatures. These once-living beings each met a particularly brutal end, often on nights of the hunt, and were cursed by the city to become voracious apparitions. They have become trapped in a never-ending cycle, feeding on the living in an attempt to regain some semblance of their former selves, but in vain.
	Parasitic geists lost their bodies along with their minds, resembling floating heads with long, writhing tendrils protruding from their ghostly faces. They use these tendrils as a means of feeding, breaking through the skin of unsuspecting victims and draining their life, guided by nothing more than a visceral hunger. The ethereal appearance of these walking corpses is hard to perceive with the naked eye, flickering in and out of existence, phasing through solid structures.
	These monsters are drawn to places where people are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain-grim banquets of blood and agony. Graveyards, battlegrounds, and other locations where death and violence prevail are where they are most often found.

    <description>These dread-filled monstrosities are the harbingers of the Scourge. Uncannily mirroring the appearance of scourgeborne, the fallen Luyarnhians are an abomination born of this dark corruption that began in the Ruby District. Sufficient instincts lingers within them to make them formidable adversaries for the unprepared. They clutch onto torches, a flicker of rationality trying to ward off the encroaching darkness. Yet, this act merely serves to cast long, monstrous shadows, turning the district into a nightmarish landscape.

Some fallen are bloated with bestial energy from their over-exposure to the Scourge. These fallen are distinguishable from others of their kind by their distended and swollen abdomen.

    <description>The corvian dwellers began appearing in the Ruby District, their warped form eerily similar to that of the scourgeborne, like fallen Luyarnhians. Their wings, heavy and matted with grime, are incapable of lifting them high enough to escape the district's confines—a blessing to others, else they'd carry their plague beyond the barricaded borders of the Ruby District.

    <description>Geists are two souls intertwined in a solemn dance of despair and suffering. Created by the will of a Great One, these souls ripped from fallen bodies now do their creator's bidding without judgment or rationale. While their appearance differs from typical ghosts, they too glide through the air with the same eerie motions as their undead brethren. Their form twists and changes, capable of resisting even the blows of magical weapons. Their existence is the reason why most hunters carry plain steel weapons as back up.

Dying Breed. When the moon was shattered, most geists broke along with it. This was the undeniable proof that the hunters had the powers to break and end the Scourge afflicting them. In Luyarnha, death offers no respite; a person's body and soul risk becoming the tortured pawns of vile masters, thus the denizens of the city show a fighting spirit rarely seen elsewhere.

    <description>Enhanced patients are victims of a macabre surgical practice designed to augment their latent psychic abilities. In an ungodly exchange, their natural sight is forever relinquished, alongside most of their intellect, instead replaced by the chilling cold of the Ocular Apparatus. This metal device, fused directly into the patient's eye socket, opens pathways to metaphysical visions beyond comprehension, linking the frail mortal consciousness with something far greater and more terrifying.
	These manipulated individuals, forever blinded to mortal sight, are left suspended in a perpetual state of ethereal revelation, their minds teetering on the brink of cosmic comprehension and madness, bestowing upon them a set of nascent psychic abilities. As living conduits to the cosmos, they form the crux of the Obitus Scholare's ongoing research—the price of their sanity, a small offering for the promise of cosmic enlightenment, holding the key to creating something far greater than meager jaegers.
