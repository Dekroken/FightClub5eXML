      <name>Litany's Influence</name>
      <text>At the start of each of the swarm's turns, each character within 60 feet of it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the character takes psychic damage equal to the swarm's hit points divided by 20, rounded down, (e.g., 50 psychic damage at 1000 hit points) and cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage and are unaffected by the reaction restriction.</text>

      <name>Swarm Movement</name>
      <text>The swarm moves as a single entity, occupying a 25-foot by 25-foot space. For every 200 hit points the horde loses, each side of its area shrinks by 5 feet.</text>

      <text>Use a single attack roll with an attack bonus equal to the swarm's hit points divided by 70, rounded down (e.g., +14 at 1000 hit points), range: 15 ft., one target. Hit: (10d6) bludgeoning damage. This damage is reduced by 1d6 for each 100 hit points the swarm has lost.</text>

      <name>Overwhelm</name>
      <text>If the swarm has more than half of its hit points remaining, it can use its action to attempt to overwhelm a character. The target must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the swarm's Strength (Athletics) check, with a bonus equal to the swarm's hit points divided by 50, rounded down (e.g., +20 at 1000 hit points). On a failure, the target is grappled (escape DC 20).</text>

    <description>Parasitic geists are defined by their unnerving appearance and insatiable appetite for living creatures. These once-living beings each met a particularly brutal end, often on nights of the hunt, and were cursed by the city to become voracious apparitions. They have become trapped in a never-ending cycle, feeding on the living in an attempt to regain some semblance of their former selves, but in vain.
	Parasitic geists lost their bodies along with their minds, resembling floating heads with long, writhing tendrils protruding from their ghostly faces. They use these tendrils as a means of feeding, breaking through the skin of unsuspecting victims and draining their life, guided by nothing more than a visceral hunger. The ethereal appearance of these walking corpses is hard to perceive with the naked eye, flickering in and out of existence, phasing through solid structures.
	These monsters are drawn to places where people are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain-grim banquets of blood and agony. Graveyards, battlegrounds, and other locations where death and violence prevail are where they are most often found.
