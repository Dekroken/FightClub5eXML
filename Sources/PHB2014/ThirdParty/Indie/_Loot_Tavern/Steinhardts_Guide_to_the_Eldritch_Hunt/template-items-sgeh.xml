    <text>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical or magical weapons are susceptible to moongilded weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons, magical or not, with moongold.
	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the moongold, but the time and expertise needed to add moongold to the weapon without making it less effective. Moongold loses its effectiveness over time; if a moongilded weapon has not been recoated in moongold after 3 months, the coating falls off, ending its effects. Recoating a weapon before it loses its moongilding costs 500 gp and refreshes the duration of the moongold.</text>
