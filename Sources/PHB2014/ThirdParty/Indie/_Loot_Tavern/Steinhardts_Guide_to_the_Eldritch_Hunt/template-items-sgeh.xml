    <text>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical or magical weapons are susceptible to moongilded weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons, magical or not, with moongold.
	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the moongold, but the time and expertise needed to add moongold to the weapon without making it less effective. Moongold loses its effectiveness over time; if a moongilded weapon has not been recoated in moongold after 3 months, the coating falls off, ending its effects. Recoating a weapon before it loses its moongilding costs 500 gp and refreshes the duration of the moongold.</text>

    <text>The Scions' weapons-whether dead or alive-are constructed from the bones of formidable monsters which are then tortured with strong lightning, granting twisted appearance and savage fury to the armament. The weapon's osseous component grants it ancient strength, and the electricity that dances across its body brutalizes all who come in contact with it.

Scionic weapons all require attunement. When attuning to such a weapon, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. This weapon has the Explosive Retreat property.

Explosive Retreat: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to detonate the creature. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The detonation pushes you 10 feet away from the creature. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>

Scionic weapons all require attunement. When attuning to such a weapon, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make attacks using this weapon, you fire electricity generated from the armament and can ignore the ammunition, barrel, or reload property of the weapon, dealing lightning damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. This weapon has the Guiding Fury property.

Guiding Fury: While holding this weapon, you can unleash the rage held within its bones to make a ranged weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, you deal the weapon's damage and lightning streaks from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a ranged weapon attack against the new target, and on a hit, deal the weapon's damage and the lightning streaks again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of guiding fury. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>

Scionic weapons all require attunement. When attuning to such a weapon, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage.

You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls made with this focus and can cast the shocking grasp cantrip, using your spellcasting modifier.
