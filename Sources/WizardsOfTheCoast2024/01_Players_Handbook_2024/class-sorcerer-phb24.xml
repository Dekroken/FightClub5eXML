      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class's description.

Cantrips:
You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

Spell Slots:
The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+:
You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells:
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

	• The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
	• You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can't have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points:
You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's level (no action required).

Creating Spell Slots:
As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

        <text>Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with Advantage or Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

        <text>You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.

The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.

Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.

Dispel:
Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

        <name>Wild Magic Sorcery: Wild Magic Surge</name>
        <text>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

Wild Magic Surge:
1d100 | Effect
01-04 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
05-08 | A creature that is Friendly toward you appears in a random unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The creature is under the DM's control and disappears 1 minute later. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a 1, a Modron Duodrone appears; on a 2, a Flumph appears; on a 3, a Modron Monodrone appears; on a 4, a Unicorn appears. See the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block.
09-12 | For the next minute, you regain 5 Hit Points at the start of each of your turns.
13-16 | Creatures have Disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.
17-20 | You are subjected to an effect that lasts for 1 minute unless its description says otherwise. Roll 1d8 to determine the effect: on a 1, you're surrounded by faint, ethereal music only you and creatures within 5 feet of you can hear; on a 2, your size increases by one size category; on a 3, you grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode from your face and vanish; on a 4, you must shout when you speak; on a 5, illusory butterflies flutter in the air within 10 feet of you; on a 6, an eye appears on your forehead, granting you Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks; on an 7, pink bubbles float out of your mouth whenever you speak; on an 8, your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue for 24 hours or until the effect is ended by a Remove Curse spell.
21-24 | For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of an action have a casting time of a Bonus Action.
25-28 | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn. You then return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
29-32 | The next time you cast a spell that deals damage within the next minute, don't roll the spell's damage dice for the damage. Instead use the highest number possible for each damage die.
33-36 | You have Resistance to all damage for the next minute.
37-40 | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While you're a plant, you have the Incapacitated condition and have Vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 Hit Points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.
41-44 | For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a Bonus Action on each of your turns.
45-48 | You and up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you have the Invisible condition for 1 minute. This invisibility ends on a creature immediately after it makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell.
49-52 | A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to Magic Missile.
53-56 | You can take one extra action on this turn.
57-60 | You cast a random spell. If the spell normally requires Concentration, it doesn't require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1, Confusion; on a 2, Fireball; on a 3, Fog Cloud; on a 4, Fly (cast on a random creature within 60 feet of you), on a 5, Grease; on a 6, Levitate (cast on yourself); on a 7, Magic Missile (cast as a level 5 spell); on an 8, Mirror Image; on a 9, Polymorph (cast on yourself), and if you fail the saving throw, you turn into a Goat (see appendix B); on a 10, See Invisibility.
61-64 | For the next minute, any flammable, nonmagical object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame, takes 1d4 Fire damage, and is burning.
65-68 | If you die within the next hour, you immediately revive as if by the Reincarnate spell.
69-72 | You have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. The DM determines the source of your fear.
73-76 | You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
77-80 | A random creature within 60 feet of you has the Poisoned condition for 1d4 hours.
81-84 | You radiate Bright Light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
85-88 | Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take 1d10 Necrotic damage. You regain Hit Points equal to the sum of the Necrotic damage dealt.
89-92 | Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take 4d10 Lightning damage.
93-96 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you have Vulnerability to Piercing damage for the next minute.
