      <text>Cave bullywugs have made their home in the deep places underground. They tend to be dark brown, olive green, light blue or even pigment-free albinos. Their eyes are pale in color, and their eyesight is adapted to the complete lack of sunlight in underground living. They are excellent scavengers and can survive on meager resources.
