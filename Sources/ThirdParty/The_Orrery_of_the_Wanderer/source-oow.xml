  <description>The Orrery of the Wanderer is an adventure for 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons included in the back half of the Acquisitions Incorporated sourcebook. It is for levels 1-6.

The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who's watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game.</description>
