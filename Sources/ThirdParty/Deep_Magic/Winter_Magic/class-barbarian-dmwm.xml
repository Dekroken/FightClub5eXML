            <name>Primal Path: Path of the Blizzard's Heart</name>
            <text>Only the hardiest of folk can survive the near constant wintry weather that besets the northern regions. Among them, barbarians following the Path of the Blizzard's Heart dance to the wind and swirling snow in mighty winter storms. When rage takes them, they whirl in a similar fashion to these storms. Even when they are calm, they barely conceal the danger beneath their surface, much like winter seems tranquil after a devastating snowstorm.

            <name>Path of the Blizzard's Heart: Stinging Snow</name>
            <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, while you rage, snow swirls around you in your space. You can see through the snow to make melee attacks without penalty, but you have disadvantage on ranged attacks. Other creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on ranged attacks against you, and you have +2 AC against melee attacks.
