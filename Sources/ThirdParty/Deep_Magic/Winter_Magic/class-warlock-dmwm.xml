        <name>Otherworldy Patron: The Frozen One</name>
        <text>Your patron is the embodiment of winter. This is typically a powerful entity of winter, such as the avatar of Boreas, but powerful ice maidens, ice devils, and other creatures associated with the cold can serve as patrons.

Your patron seeks to immerse the world in eternal winter or bring about some similar fate. Though you might not share this goal, you have sworn fealty to this being, and you act as its agent to spread winter wherever you roam.

        <name>The Frozen One: Deflective Ice</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you can bring a small chunk of ice to your aid.

As a reaction when a creature makes a weapon attack against you, the ice shields you from the attack. The creature has disadvantage on its attack roll. Regardless of the result of the attack, the ice melts away immediately afterward. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

A creature other than you that enters a space of ice must make a successful Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone in that space.

        <name>The Frozen One: Wintry Blast</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can designate a creature you see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature feels numbing cold emanating from your patron. The creature takes 10d10 cold damage and must make another Constitution saving throw. If the second saving throw is failed, the creature is also restrained for 1 minute. A creature restrained in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. After using this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
