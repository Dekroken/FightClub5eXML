    <description>The first monsters that entered the world through Riftgates were the cerebrax. They are from another world ruled entirely by psionic creatures. Oswald’s disruption of the fabric of time and space was quickly noticed by these creatures. They brought a strange curse with them and began to search for magic.

      Magic Hunters. These aberrations hunt spellcasters and drain their powers. This process fuels the psionic monsters. Having searched the multiverse for magical power they were very pleased to have found Oswald’s world.
      
      Mind Control. Cerebrax are insane, foul beings. They want to eventually take over the entire multiverse. The aberrations know they can’t compete with powerful spellcasters like Oswald, so lesser magic-users are their usual targets.
      
      Neural Network. Cerebrax can communicate with others of their kind, even through portals like Riftgates. They share a hive mind where they can access each others’ memories.

      <name>Master Transmuter</name>
      <text>Oswald can use an action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within his transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When he does so, he can choose on of the following effects. His transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until he finishes a long rest.</text>
      <text/>
      <text>Major Transformation. He can transmute one nonmagical object-no larger than a 5-foot cube-into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. He must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</text>
      <text/>
      <text>Panacea. He removes all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that he touches with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</text>
      <text/>
      <text>Restore Life. He casts the raise dead spell on a creature he touches with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in his spell book.</text>
      <text/>
      <text>Restore Youth. He touches the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Minor Alchemy</name>
      <text>He can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance to another. He performs a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes he spends performing the procedure, he can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until he loses his concentration, the material reverts to its original substance.</text>

    <description>Oswald Myrr is a legendary wizard and a new member of the Alliance of the Griffon. Some call him the Wizard of Zogg, after his homeland. Oswald currently lives in a secret woodland manor on the continent of Naern. The people of Zogg and Myrr believe the wizard died 500 years ago. However, he is still alive and on a path of redemption. Long ago he was banished from the Wizard Council for his hazardous experiments. After causing so much turmoil, the ancient mage has joined the Alliance to try to make things right. He usually rides a pegasus as his mount.

If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s soul bag. The reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>

    <description>Oswald’s mother is a horrid, insane night hag. She fell in love with Edmund Myrr and was heartbroken when their marriage ended.

      Mad Hag. When Mary lost her mind, she began to wander into other worlds. On her journey she headed further and further down a dark path.
      
      Smother Mother. She could never leave her son alone as he grew. Mary became obsessed with the talented Oswald. This behavior drove her gifted son to leave and never return.
      
      Lost Love. At the core of her madness is a broken heart. Her husband didn’t just leave her, he didn’t love her anymore. While Edmund quickly forgot about his wife, she could never get over him.

    <description>Edmund Myrr is Oswald’s father, a broken and disillusioned wizard who turned to the dark side and became a lich.

      Dark Path. Fed up with the restrictions of the Wizard Council, Edmund took drastic action. He met with necromancers from the Void and threw himself off Grim Rock. Then the evil spellcasters helped him return to the world as a Lich King. Over a short period of time, Edmund took his place as one of the seven undead Kings of the Void.

    		<description>The Nature of Swarms. 
			------
			The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.
