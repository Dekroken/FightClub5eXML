    <description>The leader of the seven adventurers is an eager paladin. Brock is bold and courageous but still rather young. He began adventuring when he was a teenager. Brock obeys the laws of the kingdom and is the epitome of a loyal companion.

      Inquisitive Warrior. His greatest quality is his endless enthusiasm and curiosity. Brock wants to explore the world and learn about places he’s never seen before. He prefers to lead from the front and does not back down from a challenge.

      Humble Beginnings. The young man grew up on a farm, far away from the bustling city of Wyld. His family is closeknit and they’re hoping he’ll return soon. His simple upbringing helps to keep him grounded. He doesn’t trust merchants and won’t believe a word they say.
      
      Chivalry is Still Alive. Brock will do anything to protect a damsel in distress. He is a romantic at heart and believes in true love.
