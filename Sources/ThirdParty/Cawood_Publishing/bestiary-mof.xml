      <text>If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the giant basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw as the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the giant basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.

The charmed creature regards the dryad queen as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the dryad queen’s control, it takes the dryad queen’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the dryad queen or its allies do something harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours, or until the dryad queen dies, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad queen’s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.

      <text>The forget frog targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it with its gaze. The target takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage, and it must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to this forget frog’s Steal Memory for 24 hours. On a failed save, the target loses all proficiencies, it can’t cast spells, it can’t understand language, and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 7, they become 7. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A greater restoration or remove curse spell cast on the target ends this effect early.</text>

			<description>Living in tiny homes and hollow trees in the woods are the smallest of fey. Although they’re small in stature, atomies can be found in large numbers throughout Everwood. These creatures are the most populous group of wild fey in Feyland.

        Ancient Roots. Atomies have lived in Feyland since it came into existence. There is evidence of their presence for thousands of years. The ruins of old atomie villages are scattered across the land.

        Wild Fey. These fey don’t belong to the Seelie or the Unseelie courts. Many atomies aren’t pleased with either court and feel the wild fey are being ignored.

        All is not Well. The legendary Well of Dreams is sacred to atomies. It is a source of power that not many fey understand. Atomies are aware something has happened to the well and a scouting party has begun a journey to the Ivory Tower.

    <description>Growing throughout Everwood are giant, magical flowers. These plants are brightly colored and smell wonderful. Most fey believe spells were used to bring the flowers to life.

      Talk Stalk. Awakened flowers are very talkative and they are easy to notice. However, conversations with these plants can drag on for hours. Sometimes they will also break out into song.

      Potent Poison. The pollen from awakened flowers has the power to put creatures to sleep. It’s not unusual to find beasts and fey sleeping nearby.
      
      Alchemical Additions. Some alchemists will use these plants in their potions. Sleep potions and other concoctions can be created from awakened flowers.

      Manipulative Maiden. The corrupted brownie queen is not what she appears to be. Using her good looks and charm, she takes advantage of whoever she can. She spends much of her time turning other brownies to the dark side.

      Shady Lady. This creature likes to venture out at night under the cover of darkness. She will also turn invisible and sneak into strangers’ camps.

      Hidden Home. The corrupted brownie queen lives in a secret hollow tree in the central part of Everwood. She knows every inch of the forest and will use this to her advantage.

    <description>Everflowers used to be members of the Seelie Court as they are followers of the arch fey Orchid. However, when Orchid (page 115) joined the rival court the everflowers joined her.

      On the Edge. Everflowers now live near the northern border of Feyland. They report what they find to the Unseelie Court. Much of the time the dancers put on performances in Everwood or Whims Town. However, these events are just a cover for their covert activities.

      Popular Performers. Many other fey enjoy the everflowers’ dances and there are hundreds of loyal fans. Most of the rumors about the dancers’ questionable activities are ignored.

    <description>One of the guardians on the Feyland border is the edge walker. These creatures patrol the boundaries of Everwood where it meets the continent of Naern and the World of Myrr.

      Border Guard. Edge walkers are followers of the good Seelie Court and usually report to fey rangersMOF or faun commanders (page 17). If any creatures cross into Feyland they warn them to act responsibly or return to their world.

      Arboreal Ambush. The edge walker can blend into the forest very well. They’ve lived in the forest all their life and know every inch of the land. Intruders are often surprised by edge walkers before they know they’ve entered Feyland.

    <description>One of the most common creatures in Feyland is the faun. They are half-humanoid, half-goat and often get mistaken for satyrs. Fauns are much more responsible and not as wild as their satyr cousins.

      Agile Fey. A whole troop of fauns racing through the woods is a sight to behold. These creatures are quick and nimble and can cover a great deal of territory in a short period of time.
      
      Good Citizens. The horned faun is an honorable creature. They see the good in others and want to make Feyland a better place for everyone.

      Seelie Soldiers. Fauns make up the bulk of the ground troops in the Seelie army. They are loyal to the king and queen and work well in large groups.

    <description>The General is the leader of an evil army of Stonefeet halfings from the continent of Naern. He has crossed over into Feyland to learn about the history of their arch enemy, the high elves.

      Fiendish Halfling. Grim halfling scouts (page 19) have discovered the ancient ruins of the elves. The devil-worshipping general is interested in discovering what he can about his enemies.

      War Footing. The high elf kingdom of Suhn has been surprised by the halflings’ attacks on their territory. The General is planning to return to Naern shortly and continue the war.

      Grim Guard. A dozen evil halfling monks serve as bodyguards for the General. They are known as the Stonefists. Two halfling wizards are also part of his entourage.

      Force for Good. Lunacorns are in the service of the Seelie Court and fight all forms of evil. Dark fey usually retreat if they know these formidable unicorns are on their way.

      Holding Court. Several lunacorns are based at the Great Tree, the home of the Seelie Court. They often accompany Queen Titania and serve as one of the many layers of protection surrounding her.

      Stoic Sentinels. With the war underway, many lunacorns have been tasked with eliminating evil thresholders. The dark fey who guard a number of portals are being picked off one by one. Taking their places are lunacorns who decide who enters or leaves Feyland.

    <description>Living underneath Everwood is a horrifying monster. The Root of All Evil is one of the most powerful creatures in the land of the Fey. This plant can take on entire armies by itself.

      Underground World. The monster has made a series of tunnels underneath the forest that lead to a massive cavern. This is its hidden, labyrinthine lair.

      Abandonment Issues. The fey in Everwood make sure to stay away from the plant’s territory. This part of the woods is considered cursed.

      Survival Game. The Root of All Evil is omnivorous, living on anything it can find in Everwood: bears, deer, and elk, as well as many kinds of plants.

    <description>Scattered across Feyland are numerous ancient standing stones. Most of them can be found near the elf ruins in Everwood.

      Ancient Guardian. These stones are actually elementals that were created when Feyland came to life thousands of years ago. They were fashioned to guard the world from intruders.

      Alignment Matters. Standing stones used to be chaotic good and keep out evil creatures. They are able to magically scan creatures and read their alignment.

      Stonewalled. However, since the Well of Dreams has been corrupted some stones have other alignments, even evil ones. This has caused all kinds of chaos as the stones have begun to attack many of the inhabitants of Everwood.

    <description>Most elf ancestors crossed over from Feyland into the continent of Naern thousands of years ago. However, some were left behind. Upon their deaths, a group of them cursed the elves who had left them behind. These are the callous twisted elven ghosts.

      Eternal Anger. These creatures have never let go of the anger that surfaced so long ago. They hate all elves and will do anything to destroy them.

      Halfling Allies. The halfling general has reached out to the elven ghosts and they are meeting to discuss further plans. He has led a group of the Stonefeet halflings deep into the Everwood to negotiate with the undead elves.

      Undead Nature. A twisted elf ghost doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The elite force of high elf rangers in Myrr and Naern are known as the Whisperers. They have crossed over into Feyland hunting for the Stonefeet halflings and their infamous leader, the General.

      Silent Partners. These elves are known for their stealth. They seem to move through the land with surprising grace. Whisperers get their names from this ability to move quietly and quickly.

      Resourceful Rangers. These rangers never give up and usually find a way to complete their covert missions. They are highly skilled and train for years before joining the ranks of the most famous rangers in the World of Myrr.

      Unicorn Riders. Most Whisperers use unicorns as their mounts.

      Highly Trained. From a young age, these fey are trained in melee and ranged combat. They are exceptional warriors and can even handle multiple opponents.

      Centaur Rivals. Even though cloud guards often work with flying centaurs, there is a rivalry. Both groups are jockeying to be the lead force in the Seelie Court’s war with the Unseelie Court.

    <description>The corruption of Feyland happened quickly because of naïve individuals like the duke. He lives with his wife in a spectacular abode in the Sugarwind Mountains. However, he has been trapped there by a powerful enchantment.

      Lost Boy. For years the loyal duke worshipped the duchess and didn’t see her dark side. Over time he lost himself in one of her nightmares. Without telling him, the duchess used his hookah to drug him.

      Handy Hookah. He has his precious hookah with him at all times. Now that he knows it was bewitched, he has put it back in working order.

      Clear Eyes. The duke is finally beginning to see what has been right in front of his eyes. His wife is an evil manipulator and he has been a fool.

    <description>Fog pours out from atop a mountain. It doesn’t seem to stop and a couple of faeries stop to watch. Inside the huge cloud of fog is a mysterious spellcaster named Father Fog.

      Shady Character. He wanders the Sugarwind Mountains and uses his magic to break into castles and wilderness manors. The old fey robs other creatures by hiding in his large fog cloud.

      Ruined Home. This spellcaster makes his home in an old ruined castle. The building is located on one of the many floating islands in the Sugarwind Mountains.

      Like a Bird. Father Fog isn’t a winged creature but he can still fly by using magic. It’s a spectacular sight to see the wizened fey flying through the air with his dark cloak blowing in the wind.

    <description>Without warning a heavy boulder is tossed at a flying goblin. The floating island nearby has suddenly come to life. Several of these islands in the Sugarwind Mountains are actually elementals. It’s almost impossible to tell which is a living creature and which is simply a floating landmass.

      Living Landscape. These monsters are usually very still but can awaken at any moment. Like other parts of Feyland, this region is an unpredictable environment.

      Hidden Hosts. Some fey build castles or other structures on these islands, not knowing they are living creatures. In some parts of the Sugarwind Mountains, entire villages have been constructed on these elementals.

      Moving Along. At times, a floating island will simply float away into another region. Some of the elementals have floated right through Riftgates into other worlds.

    <description>Numerous arrows split the air and race towards a cloud giant. The massive monster is balanced perilously on a rope bridge as the projectiles hit its chest. Then the attackers, a group of flying centaurs, soar upwards and unleash a second barrage of arrows.

      Airborne Cavalry. These winged fey make up the bulk of the air force for the Seelie Court. A number of them are stationed at the Great Tree, the home of the good fey.

      Deadly Archers. Skilled at using bows, the flying centaurs can be a formidable force in large numbers. When they team up against an enemy, they are very difficult to handle.

      Secluded Stables. Although they can be found throughout Feyland, these creatures are based in mountain stables. The Seelie Court has cloud guards protecting these remote outposts.

      Great Gastropod. Even in Feyland, this creature draws a lot of attention. Their slime is prized by fey alchemists as it is a powerful acid. Some of the members of the Unseelie Court use it on their arrows.

      Sky Life. Gale snails spend most of their time hunting for food in the skies. They usually eat birds and other smaller flying creatures.

      Island Locals. The odd creatures grow up on the isolated flying islands and aren’t usually found in other parts of Feyland. Alchemists from other parts of the world will explore the mountains looking for the valuable snails.

      Walking on Air. Believe it or not mist walkers appear to be walking on air. When they’re first taught to use their powers, they never thought they could feel so free.
      
      Mind the Gap. With their ability to move through the air, these fey find the Sugarwind Mountains a perfect place to call home. Some live with other dark fey in small settlements, others live in hidden caves.

      Blown Away. In addition to several spells, mist walkers also use a blow gun. Their darts are quite unusual and have a number of different effects.

      Treasure Island. Hidden on a distant island is the clandestine lair of these pirates. Several flying ships are based here, far away from most fey. The treasure hoard in their castle is gigantic.

The rainbow serpent announces its presence one way or another. They use violence to get their way and attempt to bully any and all other creatures.

      Rainbow’s End. These dragons create rainbows when they awaken. Those who live in the mountains know that the beautiful arcs mean danger. Rainbows will always appear near the creatures’ lairs.

      Slippery Serpent. Even though they are quite large, these monsters are very agile. Rainbow serpents can turn quickly and avoid many attacks.

      Magnificent Mounts. A few dark fey use rainbow serpents as mounts. The dragons will bond with other evil creatures and stay in their service for years.

    <description>A bulky rock creature jumps up from one floating island to another. However, some of the dirt is loose and begins to give way. Using its powerful legs, the rock leaper is able to hang on the edge and clamber up onto the surface.

      Rocky Mountain High. These elementals are made from the same rock found in the mountains of Feyland. They are difficult to find in the rocky terrain as they are so well camouflaged.

      Local Knowledge. Having spent their entire lives here, the monsters know the terrain extremely well. They use this knowledge to travel around the area and in dealing with any intruders.

    <description>Calm and polite, this scholar is known to be extremely charming. However, under the surface she is a seductive trickster. The Spring Scholar makes her home in the mountains when she’s not at the Academy.

      Academic Mouthpiece. Of the four lead scholars, the Spring Scholar is the most diplomatic. However, she is a ruthless individual who simply craves power.

      Big Plans. The scholar is under orders to meet with the Duchess of Dreams and help coordinate the Academy’s next move. However, she doesn’t think much of the haughty duchess.

      Mountain Home. The scholar has recently returned from the Academy and made many changes to her mountain castle. A large contingent of flying goblins has arrived to bolster the forces of the Unseelie Court.

    <description>Floating through the misty mountains of Feyland are gigantic whales. Their deafening thunder calls can be heard for miles around. Sky whales are wild fey and aren’t members of the Seelie or Unseelie courts.

      Cloud Creatures. These fey feel at home amongst towering mountains and low clouds. Sky whales are quite courageous and won’t back down in any confrontation.

      Mobile Mount. These enormous creatures serve as mounts for some fey. They’ll even agree to be pack animals if the deal is right.

      Interior Life. If a creature is swallowed by these behemoths, it isn’t necessarily the end of the line. Once inside the belly of whale, creatures can still survive.

      Pleasure Seeker. Known for their sweet smell, they are extremely gregarious. Sugar dragons usually have many allies in the region, including a number of dark fey.

      Dragon Delights. They are quite playful and enjoy themselves to the fullest. However, they won’t hesitate to use violence to get what they want. Their treasure hoards are usually filled with colorful gemstones and any items with unusual tastes or smells.

      Soft Spoken. Sugar dragons have syrupy, gentle voices. There is something very unsettling about their patient, soft speech.

      Winged Warrior. The evil Academy has sent these nasty fey to help gain air superiority in the Sugarwind Mountains. They have been tasked to eliminate any creature that doesn’t fall in line.

      Cleansing Quest. There are a number of wind maidens based in a wilderness manor controlled by the Academy. It is located on one of the many floating islands in the region.

      Big Problems. Wind maidens are having challenges trying to convince the giants to join their cause. The Mountain Lord and his minions aren’t enamored with the Academy.

      Big Mouth. These little monsters have an insatiable appetite and have altered the shape of the mountains. They can even destroy floating islands, disable rope bridges, and cause rockslides.

      Home Wreckers. Shocked by the damage caused by these creatures, the Seelie Court has sent fey rangers to hunt them down. Many of the tiny fey have been eliminated but their numbers are huge.

Instead, at the start of each of the luna tick’s turns, the target loses 2 (1d4) hit points due to blood loss. The luna tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 12 hit points of blood from the target, or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the luna tick.</text>
