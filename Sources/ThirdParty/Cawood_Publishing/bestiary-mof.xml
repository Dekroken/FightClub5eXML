			<description>A flash of a shining sword in the dark and your spell ends. Arcane stalkers can spell trouble for any magic user. These agile, elite warriors of the Unseelie Court are especially adept at fighting those who use magic.

        Arcane Weapon. Each arcane stalker wields a magical sword called an Arcanis Sword. Not only can the weapon do bodily harm but it can also dispel magic.

        Evil Minions of the Queen. The Queen of Darkness often uses these stealthy fey to hunt down her enemies.

        At Home in the Dark. Arcane stalkers are skilled at moving in the dark.

On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw as the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the giant basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the giant basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

    <description>The giant basilisk is the king of snakes. It is a massive green and gold monster, and a deadly killer. Some folks say the basilisk was hatched by a rooster from the egg of a toad or a snake. Legend also says this monstrosity can turn someone to stone.

      Serpent Leader. Other snakes and snake-like creatures often work in unison with giant basilisks. Although they don’t share a language, they share a common tongue.

      Rooster Retreat. Even though these monstrosities strike fear in the hearts of many, they are scared of the call of the common rooster.

      Castles and Keeps. On rare occasions, a giant basilisk makes a home in a castle or large settlement.

    <description>Hiding in the darkest places of the wilderness is a horrid, malevolent creature. The boggart usually inhabits marshes or fields. Its true form is a mystery as it often takes the form of its victim’s deepest fear. Some say the boggart is really a black shadowy creature. However, if a boggart is killed it simply dissolves.

      Hidden Homes. These monsters often hide in burrows, under bridges, in old trees, or under logs.

      Darkest Fear. Having the ability to shapechange and the ability to detect thoughts makes this monster a challenging opponent. The boggart usually changes shape when a humanoid is nearby.

      Domestic Setting. At times a boggart gets inside a dwelling and causes all kinds of havoc. Many a family has been chased from their home by this nasty fey.

    <description>Brownies are peaceful, friendly members of the good Seelie Court. This small creature looks very similar to a little elf. Honest to a fault, brownies will go out of their way to take responsibility for their actions.

      Peculiar Pacifist. The brownie will usually stay out of combat unless they are defending themselves or others. Playing dead is always an option for this small fey. In this state, it isn’t that easy to tell if the brownie is actually dead or not.

      Naturally Nimble. Although brownies are not strong, they are quite agile.

      Wilderness Home. Most brownies live in the wilderness areas of Feyland. Typical dwellings include hollow trees and burrows. They make excellent guides, as they know their territory like the backs of their small hands.

    <description>You hear the clash of swords and the sound of hooves echo through the woods. The armored centaur is the warrior version of the centaur. They are led by the Oak Lord, head of the Summer Court. This tough warrior fey can attack with its sword and its hooves. All centaurs are sworn enemies of their evil cousins, the huntaurs.

      Centaur Soldier. Unlike other centaurs, the armored versions aren’t wanderers. Most of these centaurs are part of the Seelie Court and form a significant part of the warrior ranks.

      Useful Mounts. Armored centaurs are willing to be mounts for good-aligned creatures, including their elven allies.

      Sword Masters. These fey are adept at sword fighting and can even use their melee weapons to block attacks.

    <description>The most unusual of the centaurs is the centaur mage. These fey have a number of spells at their disposal. Armored centaurs and centaur mages give the good fey a powerful force to fend off their dark foes. As with the armored centaurs, they are sworn enemies of the huntaurs.

      Summer Court. Centaur mages belong to the Summer Court, a division of the Seelie Court. Although their usual leader is the Oak Lord, ultimately these centaurs serve Titania and Oberon. A number of female centaur mages have fallen in love with the fey king.

      Arcane Focus. The centaur mage’s staff is their arcane focus. If it is destroyed or taken away, they lose any ability to cast spells.

Even in Feyland their pale bodies and large eyes are noticeable. They are extremely stealthy and are used as spies by both of the fey courts.

      Diplomatic Doppelganger. Changelings are patient and calm and make very good diplomats.

      Cautious Creature. These creatures are rather sensitive and take their time getting to know others and trying new activities. However, changelings often wander far from their homes as they are curious about other races.

      Prolific Performers. A large number of changelings end up as entertainers. Their many gifts lend themselves to the performing arts.

    <description>As you emerge into the clearing you notice a shimmering spectral elk and rider. The hooded figure holds a mighty lance pointing towards you. A doom rider has arrived to eliminate you. This dark fey is part of the Autumn Court, a division of the Unseelie Court. The rider and mount are inseparable.

      Doom Bringer. When the Skeleton King decides he needs to kill someone, he sends a doom rider to take care of it. Doom riders usually make their homes in the Bone Castle with their leader. They know the geography of Feyland very well and will use the most direct route to hunt down their prey.

      Undead Nature. The doom rider doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>While tracking the enemy, you suddenly begin to question your mission. You could be under the influence of the doubt trout. The doubt trout is a very unusual fey creature. They are usually found in rivers and lakes in Feyland. They glow bright orange and stand out in the clear blue and green bodies of water. A school of the glowing fish is quite a stunning sight.

      Drain Confidence. In the presence of these fey, one is drained of confidence and doubt begins to take over. A strange tingling sensation can be felt all over the body.

      Interior Lives. At times, powerful beings capture these creatures and place them in containers in their lairs. This puts any strangers at a significant disadvantage. Doubt trout can also double as indoor lanterns.

Once the dream terrain is activated, the dream dragon chooses what form it takes. The dream dragon also is able to use an action to have an element from the terrain strike out and attack one target, the target must succeed on DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 60 (11d10) bludgeoning damage. The hallucinatory terrain is only destroyed if the dream dragon is defeated.</text>

    <description>Without warning, a rainbow-colored dragon emerges from the depths of the forest. The dream dragon is one of the rarest of all dragons. Highly intelligent, it uses its unique breath weapon to ensnare victims.

      Bewildering Terrain. The breath of the dream dragon creates a magical terrain where the winged monster will face down its opponents. If one member of the party is drawn inside, all the heroes are sent into the dream terrain. Disturbingly, the dragon has some control over the terrain and can use it to attack its enemies. The only way to escape is to defeat the evil wyrm in combat.

      Hefty Hoarders. Dream dragons are known to collect a huge amount of treasure. They usually hide their hoard in a cavern at the center of their territory. Goblins and ogres are often enslaved to guard these hoards.

    <description>The purple dragon is a cunning, scheming dragon with many tricks up its sleeve. This monster casts spells, bellows a draconic shout, and can also attack with its jaws and claws. It delights in making complicated pacts with newcomers to Feyland.

      Magical Menace. This monster is one of the few dragons that can use magic. Purple dragons often like to toy with their prey, using their subtle spells before moving in for the kill.

      Dragon Shout. The magical shout of a purple dragon can be heard for a great distance. Trees bend and the shout usually knocks over any creatures in its path.

      Stealthy Surprise. For a creature its size, the purple dragon is surprisingly stealthy and has been known to emerge out of the shadows in the darkest parts of the woods.

If the jabberwock is near, everyone is fully aware of its presence. Fey creatures flee when this notorious dragon arrives on the scene.

      Chaos Embodied. This wild dragon is the personification of chaotic evil. It embodies violence and rage.

      Achilles Heel. Although it is a mighty foe, the jabberwock has an Achilles heel. It is vulnerable to magical swords, and with some luck it can be beheaded.

      Burble and Flame. A mighty foe, the Jabberwock can blast flames from its eyes and confuses opponents with its strange sounds.

    <description>A shadow crosses the ground. You notice a dark shape with four wings is above you. The quadrak is a smaller dragon often used as a mount.

      Fiery Opponent. Although this dragon is smaller than it cousins, it is still a dangerous opponent. It breathes fire and can attack with its jaws and claws. Quadraks enjoy bullying the weak, like their goblin allies.

      Perfect Mount. The Unseelie Court are known to use these mounts for quick strikes against their enemies. They can manoeuvre into many areas that other kinds of mounts cannot. A group of goblin riders make up the bulk of this aerial cavalry.

      Leader of the Dryads. Other dryads look up to their queen as they know what she has been through. Their leader has fallen further than any of them, yet she holds her head high.

    <description>Living at the center of Feyland is the Elder Tree. This powerful being is positioned in between the dark and light sides of the fey world. He is connected to everything and everyone.

      Deep Roots. Ultimately, the Elder Tree will protect nature above any other concerns. He can sense dangers and will intervene whenever nature is threatened.

      At the Center. The elder tree sees the big picture and doesn’t usually take sides with either the Seelie or Unseelie courts.

    <description>The fey knight is an elite warrior who serves the Seelie Court. This brave warrior forms the spine of the army and is used to dealing with the dark forces of the Unseelie Court.

      Oaken Armor. These warriors wear special enchanted suits of armor. They are made of oak but seem as light as leather armor. The fey knight’s ability to parry attacks with its sword makes it a tough foe.

      Unique Swords. All fey knights wield a unique weapon called the Sword of Light. This shinning sword can ward off dark creatures with its intense light.

    <description>Fey nobles form the elf leadership in Feyland. They are usually members of the good Seelie Court. These elves think highly of themselves and often exaggerate their influence. Most of the fey nobles make their home in the Tree Castle, the headquarters of the Seelie Court. Some have tree homes on the outskirts of Feyland. These nobles often have good relationships with the wild fey.

      Fey Service. A number of fey knights and fey rangers can be found in the service of a fey noble. These minions serve the higher-ranking elf for many years.

    <description>The fey ranger is an elite elf warrior who fights against the dark fey. This skilled elf is especially adept at stealth. Using magic, this ranger can move quietly and quickly through the thickest of woods. Their agility and magic resistance also enable these fey to minimize the damage they take.

      Forest Guardians. Striding through the deepest parts of the woods, these brave guardians fight against evil. Dark fey aren’t afraid of much but these rangers cause them to watch their backs in the woods. The fey ranger works with other good creatures; such as unicorns, treants, and sprites, to guard the forests from the forces of evil.

      Elite Warriors. The Seelie Court uses the fey rangers as part of their elite force of warriors. They are equally skilled with the sword and bow.

Many of these gregarious fey find life at the Unseelie Court more exciting.

      Popular Performances. The everflowers are known throughout the land and many creatures are fans of their performances. They never seem to tire and move with tremendous grace. Everflowers often leap into the air in the latter stages of their dances, suddenly revealing they can fly.

      Wrathful Wreck. The sensitive autumn faerie is an emotional wreck. Their only pleasure in life is using violence to cause chaos.

      Harvest Time. Autumn faeries have a strong connection to harvest time. They are more active at this time of year and can be seen near farmers’ fields.

Unlike many of the brooding fey, these faeries always look at the bright side of life. Spring faeries are members of the Seelie Court and serve Queen Titania and King Oberon. They are led day-to-day by the head of the Spring Court, the Lady of the Swans.

      Flower Fashion. These tiny fey are usually dressed in garb from their surroundings. They often wear beautiful flowers in their hair and fashion outfits from leaves. Pastel colors are their favourite colors.

    <description>Winter faeries are the cruelest of all the faeries. They are spiteful and will hold grudges forever. These tiny fey are in the service of the Snow Queen, the head of the Winter Court. This evil court is a division of the Unseelie Court. However, these faeries are not always loyal to the Queen of Darkness.

      Frozen Hearts. Obsessed with death, winter faeries won’t think twice about harming others. They will do anything they feel they can get away with it.

      Icy Swords. Like their summer cousins, these fey are armed with two swords. The swords are made of ice and the winter faeries attack twice, once with the offhand.

    <description>Large smoke rings drift down the forest trail and pass your party. Then you spot their source, a giant caterpillar is puffing on a pipe astride a large mushroom. The fey caterpillar isn’t one of the friendliest creatures. It is known to make rude comments and ask difficult questions. These fey don’t like visitors and will give them an especially difficult time.

      Peculiar Pipe. The fey caterpillar’s pipe enables them to send out magical rings. This pipe works for any creature, not just this fey.

      Puzzling Poetry. Every now and then this creature spouts obscure poems and riddles. If newcomers can make sense of any of these, the fey caterpillar will be rather impressed.

    <description>The fey-touched are humanoids who lost their minds after ending up in Feyland. Most fey-touched used to be humans. They often enter the land of the fey by going through a magical portal.

      Lost in Feyland. As the fey-touched spend more time in Feyland they forget their former lives. Most need assistance if they are to ever find their way home again.

      Collective Confusion. Simply being in the presence of these lost souls affects other creatures. Many of the local fey avoid contact with these creatures.

      Leader of the Frogs. Her minions include numerous giant frogs and giant toads, as well as the Toadman. The Toadman is her chief henchman and a powerful foe in his own right.

      Terrible Thoughts. Although mist giants can pummel most creatures into submission, they are also quite intelligent. They will take their time and gradually pick off the weakest members of a group.

      Lofty Ambitions. The mountain lord is plotting to take over Feyland by pitting the Seelie and Unseelie courts against each other.

      Towering Throne. Most giants live in a huge cave complex deep in the mountains of Feyland. A collection of rock giants, mist giants, hill giants, and ogres make up the inhabitants. The mountain lord makes his home in these caverns.

      Ogre Minions. All the ogres, including the ogre king are allied with the giants in Feyland. Many ogres are used to do the dirty work for their larger cousins.

    <description>The rock giant appears to be a walking pile of boulders. Rock giants live in the mountainous region of Feyland and serve the Mountain Lord. To their leader they barely rank above the lowly ogres. The king of the giants has little respect for these simple creatures. In rocky terrain they blend into their surroundings.

      Rock Solid. Made of solid rock, these giants are capable of withstanding tremendous damage. They also have an unlimited supply of rocks to hurl at their enemies. To throw a rock, they simply pull one off of their stony body.

      Dim-witted. Rock giants are unintelligent and can be easily fooled. The Mountain Lord only uses these giants for the simplest of tasks.

    <description>You might glimpse something small sitting on a flat rock. However, the lake gnome is a surprisingly powerful creature. They have enough magic to alter the consciousness of someone forever. Lake gnomes are deeply in touch with the very essence of nature and life itself.

      Lake Homes. The lake gnomes get their name from their traditional environment. However, these magical gnomes can also be found in rivers and other wilderness areas.

      Unknown Gnomes. Lake gnomes are smaller than any other gnomes. They also move quickly, making them difficult to see. These mysterious creatures can live up to 500 years.

      Ancient Truths. The deep wisdom hidden in Feyland is available to these remarkable beings. They see a much bigger version of reality than many others.

    <description>Leading all of the goblins is a rather eccentric character. He is by far the most powerful goblin, but is ultimately in the service of the Queen of Darkness. His appearance is rather unusual. This humanoid leader prides himself on being dressed in extravagant outfits. The goblin king also strides around playing with three crystal orbs in his hands.

      Court Trickster. He is the head trickster of the Unseelie Court. Even the rowdy gremlins admire his talents. The Queen of Darkness finds him amusing and insane. There is purpose to his madness though, he seeks more power for the lowly goblin race.

    <description>The sound of drums echoes through the mountains of Feyland. A goblin shaman has cast a spell to aid his people. Tribal Leadership. The goblin king surrounds himself with a number of these spellcasters. In the goblin hierarchy, the shamans are only surpassed by their king.

      Dark Depths. The goblin shaman is at home in the darkest caverns of the mountains. It will extinguish any sources of light immediately.

      Cruelest of them All. Goblins are known to revel in the misery of others. Their shamans are the cruelest of their kind and will torment anyone they get the upper hand on.

      Crazy King. Although the goblin king trusts his shamans, the feeling isn’t mutual. These spellcasters think the king is insane and plot to overthrow him.

    <description>Unlike its smaller cousins, the winged goblin is a bulky, muscled monster. However, like its cousins, it is still a cruel and selfish humanoid. This is a creature that enters the nightmares of those who encounter it. The winged goblin usually makes its home in caves in desolate mountain ranges. However, some of these evil humanoids have been known to live in the dark woods as well.

      Awkward Flight. This goblin also has wings, although it is a very clumsy flier. Some folk say the winged goblins are a result of foul magic and they are still learning how to use their wings.

      Cruel Captors. At times, winged goblins will take prisoners simply to play with them. They enjoy being in control and like to draw out their victims’ suffering. If someone sees a winged goblin carrying off a victim, they know it will probably end badly.

    <description>This trickster can cause all sorts of trouble. Gremlins are in the service of the Queen of Darkness and her Unseelie Court. They are often found in large groups.

      Terrible Tricksters. Gremlins are extremely violent fey that cause destruction all over Feyland. They are loathed by most, tolerated by a few.

      Mass Effect. A single gremlin is bad enough, but they are even worse when found in groups. They work together at times and cause even more havoc.

      Troublemaking Tinkers. Gremlins love tinkering with vehicles and other complex mechanisms. They have been known to sabotage wagons and sailing vessels.

    <description>Roaming the darkest woods is the forest hag. These monsters are birthed from a cursed womb. The Queen of Darkness or one of the other evil arch fey curses a child to become one with the decomposers of the forest.

      Despoiler of the Forest. This hag wants the forest around her to become as rotten as she is. She lives on hallucinogenic mushrooms that continue to warp her mind.

      Inner Rage. Deep inside the forest hag is a lost soul and that rage eats her alive. She enjoys tormenting others and bringing their downfall. Most of the inhabitants of the woods loathe her, but she is strong enough to survive on her own. Like some other hags, she can alter her appearance. This enables her to walk amongst other fey.

      Servant of the King. The harvest maidens are also loyal to the Queen of Darkness and seek to emulate her. They delight in intimidating less powerful fey.

      Relentless Rage. At the core of the hater’s being is a deep sadness. The rage and anger they manifest is really a shell that covers a vulnerable place.

      Hidden Horrors. Haters enjoy hiding in large crowds and insulting artists, those in love, and writers. They will use their magic to sow discontent and foster rumors.

      Misery Loves Company. Now and then, haters will join together in groups to steal works of art or critique artists.

    <description>The hatter is a crazy, gregarious character who wanders the woods. He enjoys toying with others and revels in confusion and chaos. This unusual fey makes odd personal remarks, recites poems, and asks complicated riddles.

      Wild Madman. There is no rhyme or reason to his actions, except maybe in his poetry. The hatter lives in the moment and enjoys it to the fullest. He is one of the wild fey and isn’t aligned with either of the courts.

      Happy Host. The hatter enjoys hosting parties in the woods for his friends and newcomers to Feyland. In fact, he seems to always be hosting some kind of party.

      Hat Attack. This strange fey wields no weapons but he can use his hats to attack. He has four kinds of magical hats that he can throw to create different effects. These hats magically appear in the hatter’s hand. The hats can be removed but the magic effect continues. The hatter has two of each kind in his bag.

    <description>Among the most terrifying sights in Feyland is this monster galloping down a forest trail. The headless horsemen are minions of the Skeleton King. A number of these strange riders are in the service of the Fall Court, a division of the Unseelie Court. They are always found riding a flaming nightmare.

      Joined at the Hip. The mount of the horseman will obey it and fight to the death to protect the rider. The rider cannot be knocked off and does not dismount. However the nightmare cannot use Ethereal Stride until the rider is slain.

      Undead Nature. A headless horseman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The bald, bluish-grey versions of the centaurs are the huntaurs. These powerfully-built creatures are the evil cousins to their centaur neighbours. Unlike the centaurs, these fey seek out conflict. They don’t like warm climates and live in the coolest, darkest areas of the woods.

      The Queen’s Army. Most huntaurs are part of the Unseelie Court and form a significant part of their warrior ranks. They are savage, brutal warriors who enjoy combat.

      Unwilling Mounts. Like the centaur mage, these creatures refuse to be used as mounts. They will fight anyone who attempts to ride them.

    <description>Perhaps the cruelest members of the Unseelie Court are the three ice princesses. These arch fey report directly to the Snow Queen, their mother. The trio of arch fey worship the snow she walks on. They are vicious, cold-hearted, and find it hard to let go of grudges.

      Palace Plot. The ice princesses know of the Snow Queen’s ambition to take the Unseelie throne from the Queen of Darkness. They support their mother and seek to undermine her rival any way they can.

      Icy Words. An icy mist pours forth when an ice princess speaks. Even worse, these dark fey have a powerful song that can freeze the listener.

    <description>Leading the Spring Court is the Lady of the Swans. She is also known as the Lady of the Lake. This good fey spends much of her time in the lakes of Feyland. She is the patient, calming voice of the good fey.

      Water Maiden. She spends much of her time in isolation and lives in bliss. There she communes with nature, her swan maidens, and giant swans. The Lady of the Swans feels a deep connection to the wilderness.

      Ancient Aid. This wise fey will help guide brave souls she judges worthy of her assistance. At times the lady will present a powerful magical sword to a hero, or send her minions to guide a lost party of adventurers.

    <description>The log shadow lurks in hollow logs in the woods. It seeks to make deals with those who enter or look inside these empty spaces. If the deal is satisfactory, the shadow will help a willing creature move quickly through the forest.

      Fey Deal. One can offer the log shadow treasure in the form of gold or precious gemstones. An alternative is to offer some kind of service to the monster.

      Consequences. If the deal is accepted by the log shadow they will teleport the target to an empty log further into the woods. However, if the deal goes badly the target will be sent to a random empty log or they’ll be attacked by the log shadow.

      Old Roots. Log shadows are formed when evil spirits are trapped in the logs by the elder tree.

    <description>The evil werebadger is one of the lycanthropes unique to Feyland. These brave creatures can blend into small communities or live in hidden burrows. They usually attack with their claws and jaws and don’t always pass on their curse.

      Vicious Vermin. They are often referred to as the wererats of the woods. These lycanthropes are cunning and sly. They form loyal clans that work together to get what they need. Werebadgers are extremely hard-working and determined. Groups of these lycanthropes can be challenging opponents.

      <text>One humanoid the werefox can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute. The charmed target obeys the werefox’s verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a command that will put them in danger, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the werefox’s charm for the next 24 hours. The werefox can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.</text>

    <description>The werefox is a sly and charming lycanthrope. They are the most curious of their kind and will usually blend into small communities. Unlike the other lycanthropes in Feyland, they keep their true form secret. They feel most at home in the deepest part of the woods.

      Charming Creatures. These lycanthropes will use their charms to get what they need. Werefoxes have dubious reputations in the land of the fey.

    <description>Wererabbits are the chief messengers for both fey courts. Rather timid at heart, these odd lycanthropes prefer to stand aside once conflict breaks out.

      Slaves to Time. As they are constantly rushing about, they are obsessed with time. They often carry hourglasses and fret about delivering the next message on time. These creatures also have a handful of spells that can help them in their duties.

      Always Anxious. Wererabbits are very neurotic and extremely timid. This high sensitivity causes them much distress.

A loud roar and the sound of intense winds sound as the wild hunt passes by.

      Leading the Charge. Their prey is chosen before they embark on the hunt. They are not part of the Seelie or Unseelie Court but do hunt for them at times.

    <description>Floating through thickest of fogs is a mist phantom. This monster is filled with evil energies. Healthy beasts flee and plants wilt. This large undead creature haunts the darkest corners of Feyland.

      Phantom Presence. Simply being in the presence of these horrors is disturbing. Any creature that gets close to the mist phantom will regret it.

      Undead Nature. A mist phantom doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The night hound is an evil fey creature that looks like a stocky mastiff. This evil monster is usually in the service of more powerful fey. These hounds are extremely stealthy and often steal treasure or kidnap children for dark fey.

      Reliable Retrievers. The night hound is known to be successful in hunting down items. There are many tales of an artifact going missing and a strange hound being reported in the area.

      Kidnappers. Most disturbing, however, are the tales of these evil fey kidnapping children. Young fey are warned about these hounds at an early age.

      Legendary Loners. Unlike most hounds and mastiffs, the night hound is a loner. They hate other hounds and mastiffs and will attack them on sight, including other night hounds.

      Dazzling Beauty. Incredibly attractive, these wild fey can blind a newcomer with their beauty. The inhabitants of Feyland know to avert their eyes from these fey.

This large arch fey is brave and bold and charges headfirst into conflicts. The Oak Lord is decisive and acts with total confidence.

      Centaur Leader. He is the leader of the centaurs and commands a mighty force of warriors. This fey cavalry makes up the bulk of the Seelie Court’s forces.

      Courting Disaster. The Oak Lord has fallen in love with Titania. He knows his obsession with her could spell trouble for the Seelie Court. However, this arch fey continues to pursue the queen at every opportunity.

    <description>Oberon rules the Seelie Court with his partner, Titania. He is the king of nature, wild places, and animals. This charming, handsome fey is taller than most fey, but he has no wings.

      Down to Earth. Unlike Titania, Oberon is very relatable and is revered by all good and neutral fey. He spends a great deal of time away from his throne with the common fey.

    <description>The ogre king is the leader of the ogres and lives in the mountainous part of Feyland. A large, dark cavern is his home. Numerous ogres, ogre magi, and minions make the cavern their home as well.

      Minor King. Considering all the powerful royalty in Feyland, this ogre is not a major player. However, he can also be underestimated at times.

      Giant Servants. The Mountain Lord and his giants often like to use the ogres to do their dirty work. Not the brightest creatures, the ogres can often be talked into dangerous tasks.

      Door Shield. The ogre king wields a large wooden door as his shield.

      Close to the King. These creatures are known to be close allies of the ogre king. They stay in close communication with their leader. However, ogre magi are much more intelligent and can manipulate the king. Some of these evil humanoids feel they can replace their leader.

      Master of Illusions. This evil fey strikes fear into the inhabitants of Feyland. Once he arrives on the scene, chaos is soon to follow. The prince enjoys blending into peaceful communities and terrorizing the locals. He despises good fey and any newcomers.

    <description>Leading the evil Unseelie Court is the powerful Queen of Darkness. She is also the queen of magic and murder. Some know her as the Queen of Bats. This ruthless arch fey rules over the two divisions of the Unseelie Court: the Winter Court and the Autumn Court. She is a hateful, spiteful monster who seeks to destroy the Seelie Court.

      Dark Sister. The queen is actually the sister of Titania, one of the leaders of the Seelie Court. Darkness overcame her and she lost her claim to the throne of the good fey.

      Evil Minions. As the leader of the Unseelie Court, the queen has numerous minions at her disposal. Six hellhounds always accompany this evil fey. Other dark fey, undead, and evil elves fill her court.

      Powerful Mount. At times the queen rides a nightmare, or a black unicorn.

    <description>Hiding in the heaviest of rainfalls, is a dangerous monster. The rainman is a cruel and vicious hunter. This fey only takes form in the rain and can’t survive out of water. It will hide in the rain and surprise its victims. Surprisingly strong, this fey will then attempt to drown the unsuspecting creature. They are one of the most hated creatures in all of Feyland.

      Patient Stalker. Rainmen have been known to stalk their victims for hours. They will wait patiently for the right moment to strike.

      Deadly Drowning. If it kills a creature, the rainman absorbs it and leaves a puddle of water behind. Once a rainman is slain, it disolves into the ground.

    <description>You glimpse what appears to be a stunning, vivid rhododendron. Suddenly a loud blast of sound hits you and you can’t hear anything. This burst of sound is from a bizarre plant known as the rhododeadrum.

      Silent Gardens. Some evil fey intentionally place these plants near their lairs. These areas are known as ‘silent gardens’. The vast area below the floating fortress of the Unseelie Court is covered in these plants.

    <description>Riverwind is the wild teenage archer of the Unseelie Court. Due to his moody nature and constant need to rebel, he is always at the center of some kind of drama. Even though he has been around for hundreds of years, he is the eternal teenager. He is still emotionally immature and impulsive.

      Winds of Change. This arch fey can conjure winds around himself to great affect. Surrounded by the changing winds of Feyland, Riverwind feels at home.

      Moody Blue. Riverwind is a brooding loner who enjoys his solitude. This lost soul is now questioning his place in the Unseelie Court and is making overtures towards the rival court.

    <description>Many fey say the most beautiful sight in their land is seeing the royal stag racing between the trees. The royal stag is the leader of all giant elks. This creature is often seen as a shining light in dark times. The royal stag protects the woods and other good-aligned creatures. It often accompanies the Oak Lord or Oberon on walks through the dense forest. Centaurs and elves are closely allied with this huge fey.

      Prize Trophy. Many evil fey have a strong desire to kill this beautiful creature and keep it as a trophy. Legend also says that the blood of the royal stag can provide immortality. This isn’t entirely true, the magical blood will enable a slain creature to be reincarnated one day later. However, the creature’s alignment is also changed to match the royal stag.

      Rotten to the Core. This undead creature is pure evil and seeks to destroy life. They are most dangerous when lining either side of a forest trail, or river. An adventuring party can find themselves attacked from both sides.

      Dark Roots. Once a ruined tree’s victim is dying on the ground, they send out their roots to decompose the victim. Then the undead monster absorbs the life form.

      <text>The siren sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the siren that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The siren must take bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the siren is incapacitated. While charmed by the siren, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other sirens. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the siren, the target must move on its turn towards the siren by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the siren, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this siren’s song for the next 24 hours.</text>

    <description>Sailors will sometimes hear a beautiful song as they near the rocky coast. This enchanting song is being sung by the siren. Its true form is part bird, part female humanoid creature. Hundreds of years ago, a jealous witch altered their beautiful form and banished these fey from the land.

      Vengeful Vixens. Sirens are out for revenge and seek to lure those near the coast. Sailors have even been known to wreck their ships as they are drawn closer to rocky shores.

      Forgotten Fey. Still angry about the curse that altered their form, sirens use their shapechange ability to return to land at times. Once on land, the siren attempts to use all its charms to lure more victims.

      Judges of the Heart. All sprites are very perceptive and can sense a creature’s alignment and emotions. The sprite knight is no exception and allies itself with other good creatures.

    <description>The storyweaver is one of the most mysterious figures in all of Feyland. Nobody knows how old he is or where he comes from. He is not allied with the two feuding courts and is truly a wild fey.

      Legendary Tales. The incredible history and stories of the fey are collected by this strange character.

      Seer. More than any other creature, except maybe the Elder Tree, the storyweaver has a window into the future.

      Important Lessons. If one listens to the tales of the storyweaver, they can always learn lessons that will help them in their lives. However, it is not a good idea to get on his bad side.

    <description>A large swan swims to the shore and then morphs into a beautiful humanoid. These fey are the handmaidens of the Lady of the Swans. As such they are part of the Spring Court, a division of the Seelie Court.

      Peaceful Pilgrims. Swan maidens are as peaceful and calm as their arch fey leader. They will only use violence to protect themselves. These pretty fey spend their time caring for the beasts and plants. If they encounter hostile foes, the inhabitants of the wild will come to their aid.

      Swan Mount. These blissful creatures usually ride on giant swans. They often use the swans to travel around rivers and lakes.

    <description>Sylphs are very beautiful winged creatures that dwell in aerial places. They enjoy wandering and aren’t often encountered in their lairs. These lairs are small caves on the sides of mountains, or high atop the tallest trees. Sylphs are solitary and are rarely found in groups.

      Greater Good. Sylphs will often aid other creatures of good alignment. They have been known to assist adventuring parties.

      Flighty Fey. These fey can walk but prefer to remain airborne. Sylphs are closely allied with air elementals and can call on their aid.

    <description>Guarding the entrances to Feyland are beings known as thresholders. These agile sentinels lurk near gates, faerie rings, and other thresholds.

      Multiple Personalities. Each thresholder is different and could be in the service of either of the fey courts. Some are completely independent and have their own motivations.

      Judging Harshly. Regardless of who or what they serve, these guardians are harsh judges. They will question any newcomers about their business and decide whether they are worthy enough to visit. If the thresholder decides the strangers aren’t worthy, it will order them to leave. Thresholders will attack anyone that disobeys their orders.

The proud queen is also the head of the Summer Court, a division of the Seelie Court. She and Oberon live in a massive forest complex known as the Tree Castle. It is located in the Great Tree and is home to her numerous minions.

      Good Queen. Her sister became corrupted by darkness and was banished from the court. Titania still has hope the Queen of Darkness can return one day. She is an eternal optimistic and refuses to let thoughts cloud her vision.

      Loyal Leader. Titania is loyal to her friends and allies, especially Oberon. Even though the Oak Lord pursues her, she ignores his romantic gestures.

    <description>The toadman is the henchman of the Frog Witch. He lives in the swampy forests of Feyland and does whatever his mistress desires. A strange frog-like humanoid, he wears studded leather armor and a ragged cloak.

      Swamp Dweller. At home in the swamp, the toadman can blend in and hide with ease. He spends most of his time at the Frog Witch’s hut.

      Amphibian Allies. The toadman forms strong bonds with giant frogs, which are often used as guardians. It also uses them as mounts. He is more popular with the denizens of the swamp than his cruel mistress. However, this fey is wise enough to know he gains many benefits as the henchman of the powerful witch.

      Deep Sickness. The Tree of Dread is a tree that was dying of disease and was awakened by dark forces. Evil druids are usually part of the long process that awakens these monsters.

      Evil Guardians. Trees of Dread protect their territory like their treant cousins. However, they use violence as their only means of solving conflict. They are extremely unpredictable and dangerous. When they gather in groups, they often overwhelm their opponents. A herd of these fey are a terrifying sight to behold.

    <description>The river troll is an absolutely massive type of troll. These huge trolls make their homes in lakes and rivers. They hunt for prey and will attempt to drown their victims. Unlike other trolls, these monsters refuse to serve anyone else.

      At Home in the Water. Although they are huge in size, river trolls are actually quite good swimmers. They are also amphibious and use this trait to surprise their victims. River trolls can hide on the bottom of large rivers or lakes for hours.

      Deadly Drownings. These horrid monsters are extremely strong and can usually drown their opponents. River trolls can also do extensive damage to objects and structures.

      Fears Fire. Attacking the river troll with fire is the only way to stop them from regenerating.

    <description>The black unicorn is an example of how the dark fey are a twisted version of reality. This evil monster is the opposite of its celestial cousin. At home in enchanted forests, it stalks its prey. This fey’s dark form and high level of awareness help it hunt in the shadows.

      Toxic Horns. The black unicorn’s white horn is a deadly tool of evil. Not only can the monster spear a victim, it does necrotic damage as well. Using dark magic, the black unicorn can also spray poison with the horn.

      Evil Mounts. At times, powerful evil beings work alongside these monsters. There are stories of anti-paladins, evil arch fey, hags, or even witches riding on these dark steeds.

    <description>The green unicorn partners with other creatures to protect the woods. This unicorn moves almost unseen through the forest world. Legend says that certain druids are chosen by the gods and reincarnated as green unicorns. These creatures are also known to ally themselves with druids to fend off enemies. A circle of druids who ally with a green unicorn becomes a formidable foe. Chaotic neutral in nature, this unicorn is wary of good and evil creatures.

      Deeply Connected. The green unicorn is deeply in touch with the forest. Other animals often ally with green unicorns to protect their territory. These fey know the woods better than any other creature.

      Mounting a Challenge. Some neutral druids use these unicorns as mounts.

    <description>The red unicorn has been corrupted by demons. They live in enchanted forests and attack any good-hearted creatures that attempt to enter. At times, these monsters ally themselves with other evil creatures.

      Fiery Horns. The red unicorn’s black horn is a deadly tool of evil. Not only can the monster spear a victim, they do fire damage as well. Using dark magic, the horn can send out magical fire bolts at will. Evil spellcasters and alchemists attempt to gain red unicorn horns for use in spells and potions.

      Hot-Tempered. These unicorns are violent and cruel beings. Unlike other unicorns, they are not stealthy and always make their presence known. They are not suitable as mounts as their bodies are dangerously hot.

    <description>The wilder, untamed cousin of the wizard is the witch. Witches can be any kind of humanoid and any gender. They often have familiars with them. The witch’s alignment affects what kind of creature will serve them.

      Two Paths. Witches can take one of two paths. There are only good and evil witches.

      Spellbooks. As with wizards, witches keep all their spells in a spellbook. If the spellbook is destroyed, so is their ability to cast spells. However, witches can also continue to add spells to their repertoire if they have their spellbooks.

      Bewitched Brooms. Most witches use magical brooms to fly around. They can travel double their speed when mounted on their brooms.

    <description>The witch king is one of the most powerful creatures in all of the land. This evil monster is the right-hand man of the Queen of Darkness. If the queen of the Unseelie Court has a mission, she calls on the witch king first. He is pure chaos and pure evil. Most creatures flee when this evil lord arrives on the scene. His badly scarred face is hidden beneath an intimidating helm.

      Sky Castle. The witch king makes the Fortress of Shade his home, when he’s not on errands for the queen. He lives in one of the highest towers of the floating castle.

      Multiple Minions. This dark fey is able to call on the might of the Unseelie Court and has many minions. Undead monsters and a number of evil fey accompany this dark lord.

      Mounting Darkness. The witch king usually rides a nightmare or a black unicorn. At times, he has even been known to take a dragon as a mount.

    <description>Giant bulbous eyes emerge from the swamp. You suddenly begin to forget how to speak and your spells don’t work. This is the forget frog, one of the oddest creatures in Feyland. They are allies of the frog witch and the toadman.

      Lost Thoughts. The gaze of the forget frog has a powerful effect. It affects spellcasters adversely and its victims are also unable to speak. Sometimes the victims of a forget frog are thought to be fey-touched.

      Poisonous. These evil frogs are also very poisonous. They can even spit this poison from afar.

    <description>Visitors to this mysterious land often encounter giant butterflies. The extraordinary patterns on their glistening wings are admired by all. These brilliantly-colored beasts begin their lives as fey caterpillars. After many years, the caterpillars spin cocoons and slowly transform into their butterfly form. Giant butterflies feed off the nectar from the large flowers.

      Common Mounts. Many creatures attempt to gain a giant butterfly mount. However, these creatures are selective. They refuse to let any evil creature ride them. Some fey believe that these creatures will bring them good fortune.

      Wind Power. These beasts beat their wings to knock down anyone or anything that attacks them or their rider.

    <description>A loud droning sound echoes through the woods and a large insect comes into view. The giant dragonfly is one of the many flying creatures in the land of the fey. However, these beasts are rarely encountered. They are extremely agile fliers and can dart between obstacles with ease.

      Magnificent Mounts. Their exceptional flying ability makes them highly prized mounts. Unlike giant butterflies, they will let anyone ride them. Both the good Seelie Court and evil Unseelie Court use these creatures as mounts.

      Dragonfly Diet. Giant dragonflies usually feed on other insects. They live off carrion when they can’t find any other food.

    <description>The giant fox is one of the most common mounts for the fey. These omnivores hunt small animals, eat birds, eggs, insects, berries, fungi, and carrion. These beasts will let fey ride them in exchange for food.

      The Pack. Giant foxes stick together and are usually found in a skulk. If they attack as a group, they can put up quite a fight.

      Hidden Home. These beasts make their homes in secretive dens. They mate for life and have litters of up to six kits.

    <description>The inquisitive giant rabbit is found throughout the land of the fey. Most fey are slightly cautious in dealing with these beasts. Many creatures are apprehensive because the wererabbit is almost as common.

      Appetites for Destruction. The few farming communities in Feyland are on guard for giant rabbits. These beasts can destroy fields full of crops in a matter of days.

      Busy Burrows. Giant rabbits usually make their homes in large burrows with many other rabbits. They have sizeable litters of young and their communities grow rapidly.

    <description>Giant swans are found on the rivers and lakes of Feyland. Their beauty and grace are legendary. With their bright white form, these beasts stand out in the green woodlands.

      Aggressive Attitudes. Giant swans are very aggressive and will not hesitate to defend themselves. They have a nasty bite.

      Mounts. Some fey creatures use these giant beasts as mounts. They are often found in the service of the Lady of the Swans and her swan maidens.

    <description>The giant tortoise is one of the largest creatures in all of Feyland. These ancient beings are also rarely seen, except in the deepest of woods. At times these monsters will enter rivers or lakes to rest. They are able to breathe underwater for a short period of time.

      Pack Animal. These massive beasts can be used to carry a huge load. Both fey courts have used these creatures in their ongoing war. Having a beast that can carry hundreds of pounds of supplies has appealed to the Seelie and Unseelie courts.

    <description>This beast is a sturdy war dog commonly used by goblins, gnomes, and halfling warriors. These beasts are a result of worgs and mastiffs breeding. They are usually outfitted with studded leather armor.

      Loyal Companion. The jarog is stubbornly loyal and will sacrifice itself for its rider. However, this stubbornness results in conflicts, especially with goblins. Jarogs will also fight for each other and work well as a pack.

      Brave Beast. This beast will never back down from a fight and has little fear of larger opponents. There are even stories of jarogs fighting off packs of worgs.

			<description>Living in tiny homes and hollow trees in the woods are the smallest of fey. Although they’re small in stature, atomies can be found in large numbers throughout Everwood. These creatures are the most populous group of wild fey in Feyland.

        Ancient Roots. Atomies have lived in Feyland since it came into existence. There is evidence of their presence for thousands of years. The ruins of old atomie villages are scattered across the land.

        Wild Fey. These fey don’t belong to the Seelie or the Unseelie courts. Many atomies aren’t pleased with either court and feel the wild fey are being ignored.

        All is not Well. The legendary Well of Dreams is sacred to atomies. It is a source of power that not many fey understand. Atomies are aware something has happened to the well and a scouting party has begun a journey to the Ivory Tower.

      Shady Lady. This creature likes to venture out at night under the cover of darkness. She will also turn invisible and sneak into strangers’ camps.

      Hidden Home. The corrupted brownie queen lives in a secret hollow tree in the central part of Everwood. She knows every inch of the forest and will use this to her advantage.

      Popular Performers. Many other fey enjoy the everflowers’ dances and there are hundreds of loyal fans. Most of the rumors about the dancers’ questionable activities are ignored.

    <description>One of the guardians on the Feyland border is the edge walker. These creatures patrol the boundaries of Everwood where it meets the continent of Naern and the World of Myrr.

      Border Guard. Edge walkers are followers of the good Seelie Court and usually report to fey rangersMOF or faun commanders (page 17). If any creatures cross into Feyland they warn them to act responsibly or return to their world.

      Arboreal Ambush. The edge walker can blend into the forest very well. They’ve lived in the forest all their life and know every inch of the land. Intruders are often surprised by edge walkers before they know they’ve entered Feyland.

    <description>One of the most common creatures in Feyland is the faun. They are half-humanoid, half-goat and often get mistaken for satyrs. Fauns are much more responsible and not as wild as their satyr cousins.

      Agile Fey. A whole troop of fauns racing through the woods is a sight to behold. These creatures are quick and nimble and can cover a great deal of territory in a short period of time.
      
      Good Citizens. The horned faun is an honorable creature. They see the good in others and want to make Feyland a better place for everyone.

      Seelie Soldiers. Fauns make up the bulk of the ground troops in the Seelie army. They are loyal to the king and queen and work well in large groups.

    <description>The General is the leader of an evil army of Stonefeet halfings from the continent of Naern. He has crossed over into Feyland to learn about the history of their arch enemy, the high elves.

      Fiendish Halfling. Grim halfling scouts (page 19) have discovered the ancient ruins of the elves. The devil-worshipping general is interested in discovering what he can about his enemies.

      War Footing. The high elf kingdom of Suhn has been surprised by the halflings’ attacks on their territory. The General is planning to return to Naern shortly and continue the war.

      Grim Guard. A dozen evil halfling monks serve as bodyguards for the General. They are known as the Stonefists. Two halfling wizards are also part of his entourage.

      Force for Good. Lunacorns are in the service of the Seelie Court and fight all forms of evil. Dark fey usually retreat if they know these formidable unicorns are on their way.

      Holding Court. Several lunacorns are based at the Great Tree, the home of the Seelie Court. They often accompany Queen Titania and serve as one of the many layers of protection surrounding her.

      Stoic Sentinels. With the war underway, many lunacorns have been tasked with eliminating evil thresholders. The dark fey who guard a number of portals are being picked off one by one. Taking their places are lunacorns who decide who enters or leaves Feyland.

    <description>Living underneath Everwood is a horrifying monster. The Root of All Evil is one of the most powerful creatures in the land of the Fey. This plant can take on entire armies by itself.

      Underground World. The monster has made a series of tunnels underneath the forest that lead to a massive cavern. This is its hidden, labyrinthine lair.

      Abandonment Issues. The fey in Everwood make sure to stay away from the plant’s territory. This part of the woods is considered cursed.

      Survival Game. The Root of All Evil is omnivorous, living on anything it can find in Everwood: bears, deer, and elk, as well as many kinds of plants.

    <description>Scattered across Feyland are numerous ancient standing stones. Most of them can be found near the elf ruins in Everwood.

      Ancient Guardian. These stones are actually elementals that were created when Feyland came to life thousands of years ago. They were fashioned to guard the world from intruders.

      Alignment Matters. Standing stones used to be chaotic good and keep out evil creatures. They are able to magically scan creatures and read their alignment.

      Stonewalled. However, since the Well of Dreams has been corrupted some stones have other alignments, even evil ones. This has caused all kinds of chaos as the stones have begun to attack many of the inhabitants of Everwood.

    <description>Most elf ancestors crossed over from Feyland into the continent of Naern thousands of years ago. However, some were left behind. Upon their deaths, a group of them cursed the elves who had left them behind. These are the callous twisted elven ghosts.

      Eternal Anger. These creatures have never let go of the anger that surfaced so long ago. They hate all elves and will do anything to destroy them.

      Halfling Allies. The halfling general has reached out to the elven ghosts and they are meeting to discuss further plans. He has led a group of the Stonefeet halflings deep into the Everwood to negotiate with the undead elves.

      Undead Nature. A twisted elf ghost doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The elite force of high elf rangers in Myrr and Naern are known as the Whisperers. They have crossed over into Feyland hunting for the Stonefeet halflings and their infamous leader, the General.

      Silent Partners. These elves are known for their stealth. They seem to move through the land with surprising grace. Whisperers get their names from this ability to move quietly and quickly.

      Resourceful Rangers. These rangers never give up and usually find a way to complete their covert missions. They are highly skilled and train for years before joining the ranks of the most famous rangers in the World of Myrr.

      Unicorn Riders. Most Whisperers use unicorns as their mounts.

      Highly Trained. From a young age, these fey are trained in melee and ranged combat. They are exceptional warriors and can even handle multiple opponents.

      Centaur Rivals. Even though cloud guards often work with flying centaurs, there is a rivalry. Both groups are jockeying to be the lead force in the Seelie Court’s war with the Unseelie Court.

    <description>The corruption of Feyland happened quickly because of naïve individuals like the duke. He lives with his wife in a spectacular abode in the Sugarwind Mountains. However, he has been trapped there by a powerful enchantment.

      Lost Boy. For years the loyal duke worshipped the duchess and didn’t see her dark side. Over time he lost himself in one of her nightmares. Without telling him, the duchess used his hookah to drug him.

      Handy Hookah. He has his precious hookah with him at all times. Now that he knows it was bewitched, he has put it back in working order.

      Clear Eyes. The duke is finally beginning to see what has been right in front of his eyes. His wife is an evil manipulator and he has been a fool.

    <description>Fog pours out from atop a mountain. It doesn’t seem to stop and a couple of faeries stop to watch. Inside the huge cloud of fog is a mysterious spellcaster named Father Fog.

      Shady Character. He wanders the Sugarwind Mountains and uses his magic to break into castles and wilderness manors. The old fey robs other creatures by hiding in his large fog cloud.

      Ruined Home. This spellcaster makes his home in an old ruined castle. The building is located on one of the many floating islands in the Sugarwind Mountains.

      Like a Bird. Father Fog isn’t a winged creature but he can still fly by using magic. It’s a spectacular sight to see the wizened fey flying through the air with his dark cloak blowing in the wind.

    <description>Without warning a heavy boulder is tossed at a flying goblin. The floating island nearby has suddenly come to life. Several of these islands in the Sugarwind Mountains are actually elementals. It’s almost impossible to tell which is a living creature and which is simply a floating landmass.

      Living Landscape. These monsters are usually very still but can awaken at any moment. Like other parts of Feyland, this region is an unpredictable environment.

      Hidden Hosts. Some fey build castles or other structures on these islands, not knowing they are living creatures. In some parts of the Sugarwind Mountains, entire villages have been constructed on these elementals.

      Moving Along. At times, a floating island will simply float away into another region. Some of the elementals have floated right through Riftgates into other worlds.

    <description>Numerous arrows split the air and race towards a cloud giant. The massive monster is balanced perilously on a rope bridge as the projectiles hit its chest. Then the attackers, a group of flying centaurs, soar upwards and unleash a second barrage of arrows.

      Airborne Cavalry. These winged fey make up the bulk of the air force for the Seelie Court. A number of them are stationed at the Great Tree, the home of the good fey.

      Deadly Archers. Skilled at using bows, the flying centaurs can be a formidable force in large numbers. When they team up against an enemy, they are very difficult to handle.

      Secluded Stables. Although they can be found throughout Feyland, these creatures are based in mountain stables. The Seelie Court has cloud guards protecting these remote outposts.

      Great Gastropod. Even in Feyland, this creature draws a lot of attention. Their slime is prized by fey alchemists as it is a powerful acid. Some of the members of the Unseelie Court use it on their arrows.

      Sky Life. Gale snails spend most of their time hunting for food in the skies. They usually eat birds and other smaller flying creatures.

      Island Locals. The odd creatures grow up on the isolated flying islands and aren’t usually found in other parts of Feyland. Alchemists from other parts of the world will explore the mountains looking for the valuable snails.

      Walking on Air. Believe it or not mist walkers appear to be walking on air. When they’re first taught to use their powers, they never thought they could feel so free.
      
      Mind the Gap. With their ability to move through the air, these fey find the Sugarwind Mountains a perfect place to call home. Some live with other dark fey in small settlements, others live in hidden caves.

      Blown Away. In addition to several spells, mist walkers also use a blow gun. Their darts are quite unusual and have a number of different effects.

      Treasure Island. Hidden on a distant island is the clandestine lair of these pirates. Several flying ships are based here, far away from most fey. The treasure hoard in their castle is gigantic.

      Rainbow’s End. These dragons create rainbows when they awaken. Those who live in the mountains know that the beautiful arcs mean danger. Rainbows will always appear near the creatures’ lairs.

      Slippery Serpent. Even though they are quite large, these monsters are very agile. Rainbow serpents can turn quickly and avoid many attacks.

      Magnificent Mounts. A few dark fey use rainbow serpents as mounts. The dragons will bond with other evil creatures and stay in their service for years.

    <description>A bulky rock creature jumps up from one floating island to another. However, some of the dirt is loose and begins to give way. Using its powerful legs, the rock leaper is able to hang on the edge and clamber up onto the surface.

      Rocky Mountain High. These elementals are made from the same rock found in the mountains of Feyland. They are difficult to find in the rocky terrain as they are so well camouflaged.

      Local Knowledge. Having spent their entire lives here, the monsters know the terrain extremely well. They use this knowledge to travel around the area and in dealing with any intruders.

    <description>Calm and polite, this scholar is known to be extremely charming. However, under the surface she is a seductive trickster. The Spring Scholar makes her home in the mountains when she’s not at the Academy.

      Academic Mouthpiece. Of the four lead scholars, the Spring Scholar is the most diplomatic. However, she is a ruthless individual who simply craves power.

      Big Plans. The scholar is under orders to meet with the Duchess of Dreams and help coordinate the Academy’s next move. However, she doesn’t think much of the haughty duchess.

      Mountain Home. The scholar has recently returned from the Academy and made many changes to her mountain castle. A large contingent of flying goblins has arrived to bolster the forces of the Unseelie Court.

    <description>Floating through the misty mountains of Feyland are gigantic whales. Their deafening thunder calls can be heard for miles around. Sky whales are wild fey and aren’t members of the Seelie or Unseelie courts.

      Cloud Creatures. These fey feel at home amongst towering mountains and low clouds. Sky whales are quite courageous and won’t back down in any confrontation.

      Mobile Mount. These enormous creatures serve as mounts for some fey. They’ll even agree to be pack animals if the deal is right.

      Interior Life. If a creature is swallowed by these behemoths, it isn’t necessarily the end of the line. Once inside the belly of whale, creatures can still survive.

      Dragon Delights. They are quite playful and enjoy themselves to the fullest. However, they won’t hesitate to use violence to get what they want. Their treasure hoards are usually filled with colorful gemstones and any items with unusual tastes or smells.

      Soft Spoken. Sugar dragons have syrupy, gentle voices. There is something very unsettling about their patient, soft speech.

      Winged Warrior. The evil Academy has sent these nasty fey to help gain air superiority in the Sugarwind Mountains. They have been tasked to eliminate any creature that doesn’t fall in line.

      Cleansing Quest. There are a number of wind maidens based in a wilderness manor controlled by the Academy. It is located on one of the many floating islands in the region.

      Big Problems. Wind maidens are having challenges trying to convince the giants to join their cause. The Mountain Lord and his minions aren’t enamored with the Academy.

      Home Wreckers. Shocked by the damage caused by these creatures, the Seelie Court has sent fey rangers to hunt them down. Many of the tiny fey have been eliminated but their numbers are huge.

      Winged Wonders. Many fey believe elven cats and flutterbies (page 54) are the most splendid creatures in all of Feyland. The patterns on both creatures’ wings are extraordinary.

      Magnificent Mounts. There are some very small fey that will ride elven cats. Atomies and brownies and other faeries enjoy these trips. It’s not uncommon to see the tiny fey riding the flying cats around the Great Tree.

    <description>Not all the Seelie Court agree on their stance regarding the Unseelie Court. Faegar has a very different point of view from most. He stands in opposition to the Lady of the Light (page 62) and Grandmother Owl (page 58).

      Court Hawk. Faegar is pleased war has finally broken out and the fate of Feyland will be decided. He is very involved in the military planning with the Oak Lord.

      Bold and the Beautiful. The handsome winged fey believes in taking swift action. He doesn’t appreciate the patient approach of most of the Seelie Court’s leadership. However, the Oak Lord sees eye-to-eye with him.

      Love Interest. Faegar has fallen in love with Victoria Van Vamp (page 68). She barely acknowledges him, but he would do anything for her.

    <description>An adventuring party catches a glimpse of a large butterfly-like creature racing through the trees. They pursue the flutterby to see where it goes. It flies higher and higher and heads towards the largest tree they’ve ever seen.

      Wondrous Wings. The beauty of the flutterby is breathtaking. Many fey are enthralled by the creature’s spectacular wings.

      Sky Riders. A number of the Seelie Court use the flutterbies as mounts. Golden knights are known to have many of the flying fey in their service. Flutterbies aren’t just beautiful, they can also blast rays from their antennae.

      Blurred Beast. Among the fastest creatures in the land is the stunning giant hummingbird. Most fey just see a blur as the beast races past. Some tiny fey will ride on the friendly beasts.

      Generous Gardeners. Giant hummingbirds spend much of their time tending to the splendid gardens that surround the Great Tree. It’s their favorite place in all of Feyland.

    <description>The purest of the fey are the glimmerlings. They are so powerful that their bodies are filled with radiant light. When they arrive on the scene, good fey are inspired and uplifted.

      Tree Guard. Many of the glimmerlings remain at the Great Tree to protect the home of the Seelie Court. They usually patrol the interior areas of the beloved tree.

      Night Shift. These extraordinary creatures don’t sleep and watch over the Seelie headquarters through the night. Their glowing light illuminates the halls and staircases of the Great Tree.

      Deep Connection. Glimmerlings are deeply connected to the healing trees (page 60) that grow around the region. Some fey believe the glowing beings were created by the astonishing plants.

    <description>The elite knights of Feyland are golden knights. They usually protect the highest-ranking members of the Seelie Court. It is easy to identify them by their astonishing golden armor.

      Legendary Loyalty. These knights will sacrifice themselves to protect those around them. They are the epitome of bravery and loyalty.

      Home Tree. Most of the knights are based at the Great Tree with the regular fey knightsMOF. However, some of these knights are sent around Feyland to help the court on other missions.

      Flutterby Mounts. The majority of golden knights ride flutterbies as their mounts.

    <description>Seated beside the king and queen is a massive owl. She spends most of her time listening and watching the proceedings. Grandmother Owl is part of the leadership of the good fey court.

      Ancient Wisdom. She is the embodiment of unconditional love. Her warmth invigorates every creature she meets. This astonishing being doesn’t judge others, she even has time to listen to members of the Unseelie Court.

      Nesting Place. Grandmother Owl is almost always in the throne room. Although she does head out late at night to fly around the region.

      Early Bird. This fey was there when Feyland was born from the Well of Dreams. She remembers everything that has happened since. No other fey has the deep knowledge that she does.

      Healing the World. Incredibly, these trees have the ability to heal. Their radiant energy can mend wounds and help keep the community safe.

      Noble Soul. Jaeden has no agenda. He has purged his ego from his soul. This arch fey would sacrifice himself to protect a good-aligned creature.

    <description>A graceful fey climbs one of the many staircases in the Great Tree. Her stunning white dress trails behind her as she leads a dozen golden knights up into the heart of the tree.

      Pure Power. The lady is made of pure power, the same energy that is in the Well of Dreams. Being in her presence feels like being in the warmth of the sun.

      Court Advisor. King Oberon and Queen Titania are known to lead the Seelie Court. However, the Lady of the Light has a strong influence on them. She is their mentor and trusted counsel.

      Good Instincts. She doesn’t question her instincts as she is fully aware of who and what she is. The lady is a close ally of Grandmother Owl. They see eye-to-eye on almost everything.

    <description>Lost maidens are young women who found their way to Feyland by accident. Now they’re trying to find their way home.

      Court Protection. If the Seelie Court finds one of these lost souls, the good fey offer their protection. Jaeden Starlight will take charge of helping the person return home.

      Capable Heroine. Lost maidens are not to be underestimated; they can look after themselves quite well. They are intelligent, skilled and rather brave. However, many of the female fey are jealous of all the attention the newcomers receive.

      Long Journey. Returning to the Material Plane is not a simple undertaking. There are Riftgates and many kinds of portals that lead back. However, finding these can be an adventure in itself. Unless they are dealing with Jaeden, a lost maiden might also have to offer something in return for a pathway home.

    <description>This demi-human was born after Oswald Myrr had an affair with Queen Titania. Even though King Oberon and Queen Titania decided to remain together, they welcomed the feisty half-elf into their family. Scarlett grew up around the Seelie Court and Feyland is her home. She is a fiercely independent ranger.

      Famous Father. Scarlett’s father is the Wizard of Zogg, a man known across the multiverse. She knows of Oswald Myrr’s mistakes and wants to help make the world a better place.

      Quest for the Well. A number of wise fey in court believe that it is vital to locate the Well of Dreams. Scarlett has been chosen to lead this mission.

      Adventuring Party. The Seelie Court have sent a trio of fey rangers and a spellcaster with the young woman. It is hoped the small band of heroes will locate the legendary well.

      Elder Emissary. The Elder Tree has two emissaries it sends around Feyland, the Snake of Life and the Neverever Beast (page 102). Both creatures bring his message of peace and offer counsel for other fey.

      Powerful Message. When the snake speaks, every- one listens to every word he says. The creature radiates power and is a force of nature. It will bring up any concerns from the Elder Tree.

      True Leaders. Steppers are based at the Great Tree and rank higher than many of the other fey in the court. They set an example for others and are highly respected by the king and queen.

      Mischievous Monsters. However, there is another side to these charming corgis. They are greedy and independent. Wild corgis get into all sorts of trouble in the Great Tree.

    <description>Hard at work in the Whims Town bakeries are skilled faeries. They never seem to stop baking and the kitchens are filled with them.

      Salty Mouths. Baker faeries are known to be the most foul-mouthed faeries in Feyland. They’ve made up an entirely new vocabulary that most fey would rather never hear.

      Popular Pastries. Their baking skills are the best in the land and their treats are highly sought after. Most baker faeries can make a lot of gold in Whims Town.

      Eyes and Ears. In addition to baking delicious delights, these evil creatures also work for the Unseelie Court. Baker faeries spy on the inhabitants of the rowdy settlement and report to the dark court.

    <description>Bella Rose is convinced she’s the most beautiful barmaid in all of Feyland. She is Shady Slim’s (page 86) favored companion. Bella arrived in Feyland a year ago from the World of Myrr and decided to stay.

      Femme Fatale. She often plays the victim and complains endlessly. In truth, the young half-elf is more than capable. She craves power and believes her relationship with Shady Slim will prove beneficial.

      Terrible Temptress. Bella is greedy and incredibly vain. She wouldn’t think twice about betraying Slim either. The half-elf is eager to visit the Fortress of Shade in the Darklands and meet more members of the evil court.

      Bombastic Fantastic. Shady Slim is in love with Cherry Bomb and constantly asks her to join his gang. He visits the Marshmellow Mushroom tavern on a daily basis.

      Vacation Plans. The sassy barmaid met Count Batty (page 116) when he was in town recently. Cherry has made plans to travel to the Darklands and visit the charming fey.

    <description>The chief henchman of Shady Slim is Cobweb Kelly. This spider-like fey is feared by the local inhabitants of Whims Town. Once a week a victim is discovered wrapped in a spider web under the docks.

      Troubled Tavern. The Dark Tails tavern is usually a chaotic place. However, Cobweb Kelly enjoys it and calls the place home.

      Lake Lures. She often takes a boat out and explores the nearby Lazy River. The adventurous fey goes fishing by attaching lures to her spider thread.

    <description>One of the most famous individuals in all of Feyland is the Hatter. The strange character seems to have lost his mind and marches to his own drummer. He has been corrupted and has joined the Unseelie Court.

      Mad World. Feyland has been turned upside down by the power unleashed from the Well of Dreams. The Hatter is reveling in the chaos and his new powers. Stunned at the sudden change, the Seelie Court is trying to figure out how to deal with this eccentric fellow.

      Weaponized Wag. The dark court knows that unleashing the Hatter will result in pandemonium. He is on the loose, and nobody really knows what he’ll do next.

      Party People. The Hatter is holding wild tea parties all over the land of the Fey. He uses the parties to corrupt other fey and bolster the power of the Unseelie Court.

      Inside Joke. None of the inhabitants of Whims Town take these fey seriously. They are considered unworthy of the attention they crave.

      New Audience. A few edgelords have discovered Riftgates that can transport them to the Material Plane. They are eager to find creatures that are un- aware of their schemes.

He was one of the first creatures affected by the corruption of the Well of Dreams. Gene believes every fey should follow their most base desires. He’s hard not to notice as he screams and bawls constantly.

      Simple Minds. The genie views fey and humanoids as simpletons. He thinks that most of them are barely intelligent enough to make their way home each night.

      Many Tastes. Gene will eat almost anything and fey often bring him strange meals. His diet includes peculiar fungi found in the Lush Wild.

    <description>Jim Jam is the best-known barkeep in Whims Town. This pudgy dwarf is on good terms with many of the locals and regular visitors. He keeps his eyes and ears open and passes on information to the gangster Shady Slim (page 86).

      Bearded Barkeep. The dwarf works at the popular Marshmellow Mushroom tavern. He is good friends with Cherry Bomb and Cobweb Kelly.

      Self-Centered Storyteller. Many of the locals in Whims Town enjoy listening to Jim Jam’s colorful tales. He’s got a big head from all of the attention and has become rather arrogant.

      History Buff. Jim Jam loves to boast about his knowledge of the history of Feyland. Although most of what he has learned is from poorly written, biased tomes.

    <description>If an evil fey needs to find someone in Feyland, Orion is the first to be notified. He is the most famous bounty hunter in Whims Town.

      Hardened Hunter. Orion has been tracking creatures down for many, many years. He has many contacts around Whims Town and in the Unseelie Court. Most of the local inhabitants will help Orion out of fear.

      Focused Fey. The bounty hunter is a very serious individual and hunts down his targets quickly. He is a determined, disciplined warrior.

      Hidden Lair. A number of buildings are hidden underneath Whims Town. This is where Orion makes his home. A group of nefarious bounty hunters lives with the well-known fey.

    <description>The Puzzleman is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. He meanders around Whims Town, observing daily life. Most of the inhabitants of the busy settlement leave him alone.

      Unique Fey. In a land of strange creatures, the Puzzleman is one of the most curious. Few of the fey in Whims Town know anything about him.

      In Plain Sight. Using his remarkable ability to turn into objects, Puzzleman can hide almost anywhere. He likes to travel around town and watch all the action. To protect himself he can rearrange pieces of himself to dodge attacks. He can also slam pieces of his body into other creatures.

      Piece of Mind. Most inhabitants say the real puzzle is what is going on in the fey’s mind. What they don’t understand is that his mind is completely empty. Puzzleman is fully present in the moment and has no agenda at all.

The possession ends after that period of doubt or the trout is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the self-doubt trout reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to the trout’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>
    </action>
    <description>The doubt trout is one of the oddest creatures in this realm. However, this undead monster is even more unusual. The self-doubt trout is created by a necromancer who finds a dead doubt trout.

      Inside Job. The main goal of the self-doubt trout is to possess a creature and fill them with doubt. This occurs much like a ghost possessing a living being.

      Blame Game. Some fey blame the elves for bringing these creatures to Feyland. They often refer to them as the elf doubt trout. This isn’t true of course, it’s because of necromancers like Phineas Gloom.

      Undead Nature. A self-doubt trout doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

At times it seems as if shadows are acting independently in the settlement, but it’s actually these monsters moving about.

      Unfinished Business. These undead confront visitors to Feyland and bring them all kinds of grief. They are jealous of anyone who is still alive and has the ability to return home. The foul monsters will harass any newcomers to Whims Town.

    <description>Shady Slim is the most notorious gangster in Whims Town. For all intents and purposes, he is in charge of the settlement. He is calm, patient, and vicious. Slim is currently romantically involved with Bella Rose and his chief henchman is Cobweb Kelly.

      Gangly Gangster. This tall fey stands out in a crowd, and that is saying a lot in Feyland. His odd hat can be seen from far away and his silhouette is rather unique.

      Power Broker. Slim owns most of the taverns, inns, and shops in Whims Town. He will deal with any competition swiftly and in a brutal fashion.

      Enchanted Manor. The foul gangster lives in a magical manor on the edge of town. Only he and his minions can gain access by an enchanted statue that stands on the grounds.

    <description>Sylvan spies usually work for the Seelie or Unseelie courts. Although some are in the service of wild fey like the Frog Witch (page 92) or the Mountain LordMOF. At times they gather information, other times they are simply assassins.

      Arcane Rogue. Sylvan spies use a number of spells to fulfill their missions. They often use the disguise self spell when they go undercover.

      Cunning Chameleons. These fey know Feyland well and can adapt to whatever region they find themselves in. They often have intricate backstories and some of their stories are even true.

      Perpetual Pandemonium. Even if sylvan spies are in the service of one of the courts, they will sometimes act independently. A few of the spies are double agents, playing off both the Seelie and Unseelie factions.

      Gaming the System. The Toymaker is interested in spreading his toys around Feyland to gather information for the Unseelie Court. His constructs collect information on those who play with them.

      Playing Around. He loves to experiment and is constantly building new toy constructs. Loud noises and strange smells emanate from his busy workshop.

      Express Delivery. Zoomers are incredibly fast and most creatures simply see a blur when they pass them. Their lives are shorter than most fey and they plan to make the most of their time.

      Independent Actors. These wild fey are free and don’t belong to either court. They have no interest in the war that has broken out.

      Moving On. Zoomers can live almost anywhere and are found throughout Feyland. Some live in trees, some in hollow logs, others will even hide in castles or manors.

    <description>Living in the Lush Wild is the horrid Frog Witch. She has recently been corrupted by the Well of Dreams. If those in Feyland thought she was a menace before, they haven’t seen anything yet.

      Big Ambitions. The patient Frog Witch used to be content ruling from her swamp in the Lush Wild. She has her eyes on a much larger prize now, believing she can use the war for her advantage and usurp the Unseelie Court. The cunning hag is now expanding her swamp and building an underwater town.

      Leap Ahead. She has gained more power from the magical well and rivals the arch fey in her new form. The slimy villain has learned new spells and has enhanced her dangerous staff.

      Swamp World. Not only does the notorious henchman known as the Toadman serve the witch, but many others have joined her cause. Giant frogs, giant toads, river trolls, strange fish, and many other creatures have rallied around her.

    <description>The swan maidens have also been corrupted by the Well of Dreams. These evil fey have joined the Unseelie Court. Although the Lady of the Swans remains with the Seelie Court, they have swapped sides.

      Always Angry. Usually peaceful, these corrupted fey are now part of the war for Feyland. They are hostile and aggressive, nothing like their former selves.

      Future is Female. These fey dislike male creatures of any kind and will attack them on sight.

      Swan Mount. Corrupted swan maidens ride giant swans as their mounts.

    <description>The Frog Witch rides through the swamp on her giant frog mount. Her entourage stops to watch a frog dragon fly overhead. Then the strange winged monster dives into the murky waters of the Lazy River.

      Water World. This bizarre dragon often swims through the Lush Wild hunting for food. It can dive down and spend hours below the surface eating fish and plants.

      Social Distancing. Using their breath weapon from afar is a favorite tactic of the frog dragon. It will begin with this attack and then move in to use its jaws and tail.

      Dragon’s Lair. The frog dragon lives in a large dam-like structure it creates by using plants, mud, and anything else it can find.

      Horrid Horde. These creatures will attempt to overwhelm opponents with much larger numbers. They don’t usually travel in groups of less than half a dozen.

      Construction Work. Recently a number of the frog knights have been enlisted by the witch to help create an underwater town. There has been some grumbling from the frogs who don’t feel it should be their job.

      Swamp Sprawl. As the Frog Witch builds her underwater town, she is using frog knights to move out the local populace. Many fey in the Lush Wild are upset with the witch and are ripe for a rebellion.

    <description>A patrol of frog knights makes its way through the Lush Wild. They’re exhausted from their regular duties and working on the underwater town construction site. A gigantic creature suddenly rises out of the swamp and blasts its trumpet. The frogs are blown backwards by the Grootslang, flying onto some nearby giant lily pads.

      The Elephant in the Swamp. The fey who live in the swamp don’t even like to discuss this monster. They prefer not to mention it and stay far away. It’s a well-known saying in Feyland, “Don’t mention the elephant in the swamp”.

      Marsh Monster. Some fey believe that the Grootslang is an alien from another plane. There is a strong likelihood it came through a Riftgate.

      Stone Sanctuary. The lair of the Grootslang is near an ancient circle of standing stones. No beasts live within miles of the monster’s home.

    <description>This tiny flying creature can cause big problems in the Lush Wild. Luna ticks are found throughout the humid, swampy region. They are even found as far as Whims Town.

      Bothersome Bug. These fey might be small but they pack a big punch. Luna ticks can even kill much larger creatures.

      Blood Sucker. The horrible bugs drain blood from their victims. This can be a lethal attack for an unlucky visitor to the Lush Wild.

      Patio Lanterns. Many fey trap luna ticks in containers and use them as a light source. Their golden light is the first warning sign that the pesky monsters are present.

    <description>A group of heroes cautiously makes its way down the Lazy River. Suddenly laughter echoes across the murky water. The last thing the adventurers ever see are large eyes piercing the surface of the river. 
      
      Troublesome Terrain. Mockodiles are cruel, cunning creatures that like to surprise their victims. The Lush Wild gives them ample opportunity to do just that.

      Horrid Hunter. Their powerful jaws can do a lot of damage and many creatures simply flee when the monsters arrive on the scene. The fey crocodiles are lethal killing machines.

      Loquacious Lizard. Mockodiles enjoy teasing and toying with their victims. They use colorful language and will even recite poems or riddles.

    <description>One of the oldest creatures in Feyland is the Neverever Beast. Like the Snake of Life, it is closely allied with the Elder Tree. Some say it was created from the Well of Dreams when the world came to life.

      Monstrous Messenger. Like the Snake of Life, the Neverever Beast acts on behalf of the Elder Tree and spreads its message of peace. The Neverever Beast is currently watching the activities of the Frog Witch.

      Massive Statement. This sizeable creature is an intimidating presence and can take on either fey army singlehandedly. It prefers to act as a deterrent, but it will show its ferocious side if necessary.

    <description>Riverdancers live in and around the Lazy River. They are fey who spend much of their time dancing on water. Unlike most creatures they can actually walk on water.

      Graceful Gang. The evil riverdancers appear to be quite lovely and elegant on the surface. In truth they are cruel killers.

      Curtain Call. Many fey know that seeing the dance of the riverdancers might be the last thing they do. Other fey will avoid these thugs if they can.

      Agents of the Court. Although they were wild fey, they’ve been corrupted by the Well of Dreams and joined the Unseelie Court. They act as spies and report back to Whims Town to contacts within the dark court.

      Fiery Fellow. This fey is an intense, hot-headed creature. He is extremely loyal and would do anything for the Academy and the Unseelie Court.

      Temper Tantrums. The Scholar of Summer is renowned for his epic tantrums. Paint will peel from the walls of castles when he starts shouting and raving like a lunatic. More than any of the other scholars at the Academy he encourages his students to listen to their feelings and act on them.

      Swamp Ruins. While this fey is in the Lush Wild, he and his minions are camping in a desolate ruin. None of them are pleased to be in the region but they’ll do what they can for their cause.

    <description>To deal with the growing threat of the Frog Witch, the Seelie Court has dispatched scout faeries to the Lush Wild. These tiny fey are monitoring the witch’s activities and report back to the Great Tree.

      Surprising Strength. Scout faeries are often overlooked due to their size. However, this is a mistake; the small fey are more than capable. Unlike most fey they are rather serious and extremely focused.

      Practical Magic. Agile and fast, these faeries are built to get in and out of enemy territory. They are also quite resourceful and can live almost anywhere.

      Beast Buddies. Scout faeries get along with beasts and enjoy their company. These fey will enlist the help of many kinds of creatures from the wilderness.

    <description>Living in the swampy Lush Wild is a horrid group of undead. Humanoid creatures that got lost and died in this region are reanimated by necromancers like Phineas Gloom.

      Dirty Work. Lurking in the gloomy terrain of this region, the swamp people will ambush their victims. As they’re not living creatures, they can hide underwater or in the mud indefinitely.

      Undead Nature. A swamp person doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

On a failure a target takes 16 (3d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 20 feet away from the whirlybird in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a rock or a wall, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn’t flung away or knocked prone.</text>

    <description>Hunting the skies above the swamp region is a dangerous winged creature. The large whirlybird will swoop down and attack its prey without hesitation. They surprise most victims with their whirlwind ability and then move in for the kill.

      Open Skies. These creatures like to take over an area and then hunt for days. There aren’t many threats to the whirlybirds, except for a rare dragon or two.

      Avian Appetite. The whirlwind effect of these fey can actually change the landscape. It’s not hard to find evidence of one of their attacks.

    <description>After toying with the idea of changing sides, Orchid has finally done it. The arch fey left the Seelie Court and joined the rival court when the Well of Dreams was corrupted. She was overcome by dark magic and made the dramatic change.

      Ultimate Betrayal. Orchid left her past behind her for what she sees as a more exciting life. The young fey was bored at court in the Great Tree. She had always admired the Unseelie Court and is very pleased with her decision. Her loyal everflower dancers have made the switch as well.

      Hard Feelings. The arch fey’s former companions were stunned and can’t believe she’s turned to the dark side. The Seelie Court is determined to punish her for betraying them.

      Counted Out. Recently Orchid has been charmed by the creepy Count Batty (page 116). She lives with the vampire in one of the towers in the Fortress of Shade.

      Scary Stinger. Most wyverns have lethal stingers and the dark wyvern’s is even more dangerous. Along with quadraksMOF and flying goblinsMOF they make up most the Unseelie Court’s air forces.

      Wicked Games. The sight of these black wyverns circling the orange skies of the Darklands is unsettling. These creatures aren’t bothered by the lightning and dust storms.

    <description>An enormous scarecrow wanders across the Darklands under a full moon. Then it spies a group of centaur intruders. It opens up its grotesque mouth and screams. It’s the last thing the centaurs ever hear.
      
      Queen’s Construct. The Queen of Darkness personally created these constructs. She has even enchanted the monsters with her terrifying scream.

      Dark Guardians. Giant scarecrows are scattered around the spooky region. They serve as guardians for the Unseelie Court, warding off any intruders.

      Constructed Nature. A giant scarecrow doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Leading the contingents of huntaurs for the Unseelie Court are huntaur warlords. They are the largest, most fierce of the huntaurs in the evil court. These cousins of the centaurs are feared throughout Feyland.

      Dark Warrior. Huntaur warlords spend much of their time training huntaur troops in the Darklands. They lead complicated, grueling war games.

      Ground Forces. All the huntaurs in the Darklands can only access the Fortress of Shade when it lands on the ground. Unless they’re already inside, the stronghold is unreachable when it’s airborne.

    <description>An absurd clown is the strangest monster in the Darklands. Long Legs is an unusual fey and the colorful fellow stands out in the barren wasteland.

      Dark Humor. This evil clown wanders the Darklands and toys with any creature he encounters. Long Legs loves to play cruel jokes and torture weaker creatures.

      Court Jester. The Queen of Darkness enjoys his twisted sense of humor and treats the fey as if he is her court jester. Long Legs is often invited by the queen to entertain in the Fortress of Shade.

      Hut Life. His home is a lopsided hut in an isolated canyon. It appears to be a regular-sized building, but it’s very spacious inside.

    <description>The Darklands are home to the Unseelie Court and the Fortress of Shade. Pumpkin bats are plentiful in the skies of this desolate land. These unique creatures live in a region of Feyland where autumn never ends.

      Surreal Sight. Flying through the air, this creature lights up everything around it. Some fey find the spectacle of dozens of these monsters rather beautiful.

      Fiery Fey. The pumpkin bat’s breath packs a punch. If a group of the creatures are attacking, the sky can appear to be on fire.

      Interior Lighting. Some evil fey capture these creatures and hang them up as a light source. The Unseelie Court’s Fortress of Shade is filled with pumpkin bats.

    <description>The Scholar of Autumn is a rather moody, melancholy individual. She is the most unpredictable of the four seasonal scholars from the Academy.

      Melancholy Megalomaniac. Eternally sad, this brooding sage has a cloud of negativity hanging over her at all times. There is an actual gloomy, gray cloud hovering above her.

      Sad State of Affairs. The scholar is never satisfied. She’s always criticizing something and plotting to rise in the ranks of the Unseelie Court.

      Mischievous Madame. The Scholar of Autumn would love to take over leadership of the Autumn Court herself. She constantly undermines the power- ful Skeleton King.

    <description>Strangelove is an evil illusionist who usually accompanies the Queen of Darkness. The one-eyed creature even scares the members of the Unseelie Court. He enjoys his solitude in the dungeons of the Fortress of Shade.

      Dungeon Denizen. The catacombs beneath the immense fortress appear to go on for miles. Some fey believe the dungeons rival the size of the Frozen Labyrinth that surrounds the Ivory Tower. This is the hidden lair of Strangelove, the place where he conducts experiments.

      Time and Space. Strangelove is obsessed with the nature of reality. He experiments daily, sometimes all night as well.

      Myrr Fan. This spellcasting fey idolizes the human wizard Oswald Myrr. Strangelove has learned much about the famous mage’s work and is particularly interested in using Riftgates to travel the multiverse.

    <description>Trick and Treat spends most of its time in the Fortress of Shade. It likes to practice its tricks on the lowly minions of the evil court. Most creatures in the fortress aren’t fans of this eccentric fey.

      Court Favorite. However, the Queen of Darkness thinks Trick and Treat is funny. She lets the monster torment her minions and laughs off any complaints.

      Out of this World. The queen will even send Trick and Treat to the ordinary world. She laughs hysterically for hours when her minions retell the horrifying tales of the fey’s journeys.

      Homeland Insecurity. Trick and Treat also ventures into other parts of Feyland to scare and intimidate other fey. The Seelie Court has a bounty out on the horrible monster.

    <description>The most dangerous of all the witches and hags in Feyland is the Witch Queen. She is a close advisor of the Queen of Darkness and lives in the Fortress of Shade.

      Dark Coven. This witch leads a coven of four that reside in the flying stronghold. Other fey aren’t fond of hearing these witches cackling as they ride their broomsticks through the many canyons.

      Witch Rival. The Witch Queen is not a fan of the Witch KingMOF She is jealous that the Queen of Darkness has appointed him as her chief henchman.

      Two Worlds. Tiring of life in Feyland, the witch often travels to the ordinary world. Once there she gathers potion ingredients that she can’t find back in the land of the Fey.

    <description>Hidden in the many libraries in the Ivory Tower are tiny worm-like fey. They live wherever books are found in large quantities. Bookworms are very hard to find and are often overlooked by the inhabitants of the crowded tower.

      Hungry for Knowledge. These little creatures consume books and gain the knowledge and arcane power contained within. This is how they gained their ability to cast spells.

      Sinister Spellcaster. The bookworm can cast spells three times a day. They love to use these spells to cause chaos in the tower.

      Librarian Allies. Many of the librarians in the Academy are aware of the bookworms. Some try to rid the tower of the bothersome fey, but most actually help the tiny monsters.

    <description>While the chancellor is the highest-ranking scholar in the Academy, the Dean of Dreams deals with the day-to-day affairs. He is rather uptight and expects much from the other scholars.

      Lost in Thought. The dean is supposed to be running the Academy but is often lost in his own thoughts. His high expectations for others don’t line up with those for himself.

      Reach for the Top. Ultimately the Dean of Dreams wants the chancellor’s position. He doesn’t care about the students in the Academy but tries to keep the scholars happy.

      Academic Entourage. A couple of the Punk Scholars (page 144) and several of the Faultless (page 135) are usually at the Dean’s side as he goes about his day. His chamber is located near the entrance to the Ivory Tower.

    <description>After some areas of the Ivory Tower had been abandoned for many years, the Unseelie Court reopened them. One of the first things to be discovered inside were strange dust monsters.

      Unknown Origin. Nobody knows where, or how dust monsters came into being. Although some scholars theorize the creatures must come from the years of toxic dust that has built up in the tower.

      Punk Plans. Now that the Punks are taking a leading role in the Unseelie Court, they don’t mind these creatures wandering the halls of the Academy. The fact that the monsters might attack students or faculty doesn’t seem to bother the new administration.

    <description>Students at the Academy are known as the Faultless. They have come to the Ivory Tower to learn from experienced scholars. However, the Academy has a new agenda that trumps any learning.

      Entitled Expectations. The Faultless have grown up being told they can be whatever that want and have whatever they want. They expect to be pampered and protected like very young fey.

      Fanatical Feelings. Scholars at the Academy teach the Faultless to be led by their feelings. Their natural instincts are not be trusted. As a result, these students are hypersensitive and extremely immature.

      Power Play. The Faultless have been brainwashed to believe that everyone must agree with their beliefs. They are convinced they are always in the right and anyone who doesn’t agree is worthless.

      Single-Minded. These monstrosities are warriors who simply smash their opponents. They only know one way to deal with their problems.

      Loyal Guard. The horned horrors are loyal to the Unseelie Court and will do whatever they’re asked to. They are also used as bodyguards by some of the scholars in the tower.

    <description>A few of the students from the Ivory Tower decide to explore the surrounding wilderness. Suddenly a couple of giant snow creatures emerge from a snowy pass. The frightened students drop their books and race back towards the tower.
      
      Campus Bullies. Giant yetis are mean, thuggish monsters that roam the area surrounding the Frozen Labyrinth. They like to bully any creatures they encounter.

      Winter Court. The ugly louts live in spacious ice caves near the Ice Palace and are part of the Winter Court. They aren’t fond of their arch fey leaders but obey out of fear.

      Matter over Mind. While much of the Unseelie Court in this region is made up of scholars, the yetis provide the muscle. They’re jealous of the wealthy, pretentious students who attend the Academy.

    <description>Seated in the highest chamber of the Ivory Tower is the Head Chancellor. He is the leader of the Academy, now heavily under the influence of Thelonius Punk (page 149). The chancellor exploits his position for his own gain and couldn’t care less what the scholars and students do.

      Big Fey on Campus. This fey is one of the largest creatures in the tower. The hallways and chambers are all constructed so creatures the size of the chancellor can move around easily.

      Secret Plots. The Academy has been shaken recently. First Thelonius and his faction seized the Ivory Tower and academic institution within. Now sinister plots seem to lurk around every corner.

      Evil Escorts. A quartet of frozen minotaurs guard the chancellor as he travels around the tower. He also has an adult white dragon named Emeritus that he uses to fly around Feyland.

    <description>The Ice Prince is one of the youngest members of the Winter Court. He lives in the elegant Ice Palace with his aunt, also known as the Snow Queen.

      Labyrinthian Lurker. This spoiled prince loves to fly through the frozen maze that surrounds the Ivory Tower. He is often accompanied by ice wings (page 140) for his protection.

      New Ally. The young fey royal recently found an ally in the Scholar of Winter (page 146). They are hatching a secret plot to overthrow Thelonius Punk and his rebel faction.

      Palace Life. A lazy individual, the prince enjoys his luxurious life in the palace. Many nervous servants cater to his every need.

    <description>Patrolling the skies around the Ivory Tower are hideous bird-like creatures called ice wings. They are cruel and crafty.

      Cold Customer. Ice wings are just as brutal as the frost minotaurs who also patrol the region. The winged fey enjoy snatching creatures from the labyrinth and dropping them in the nearby Lost Sea.

      Rough Rivals. Down on the ground, the minotaurs aren’t fond of the ice wings. Fights often break out when the two groups meet. A few frost minotaurs have even been thrown off the tower by ice wings.

      Frozen Statues. When the flying fey aren’t on patrol, they perch on the Ivory Tower. The designers of the soaring structure built it to match the ice wings’ features.

    <description>As a student waits for the text they requested, a strange creature slithers across the stone floor of the main library. It reaches up effortlessly to the highest shelf with one of its long tentacles. The Keeper of the Tomes is the head librarian in the Ivory Tower.

      Hidden Agenda. This fey was one of the first creatures corrupted by the Well of Dreams. She had grown tired of the Academy rules and was ready for a change.

      Wicked Wordsmith. The keeper is able to twist words and confuse others quite easily. Most fey know better than to strike up a conversation with her.

      Silent Sidekick. A library golem (page 142) usually accompanies this venerable librarian. She likes to have one around to do menial tasks, especially shelving books. It also serves as a formidable bodyguard.

    <description>The main library in the Ivory Tower seemed quiet as a Seelie spy entered. Without warning, a bookcase suddenly comes to life. The large magical construct with metal quills for hands advances on the intruder. Books are then launched off the shelves, pelting the fey spy.

      On the Shelf. The library golem sits still and blends into the woodwork. The books on their shelves are magical and can’t be removed. The titles featured are all horror stories.

      Tome Home. However, books can be stored in the empty spaces on the construct’s shelves. These books can be removed if the golem doesn’t attack.

      Hall Monitor. At times the library golems are positioned in the hallways of the tower. Problematic scholars, students or intruders will be dealt with quickly.

      Constructed Nature. A library golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The newest scholar at the Academy is Modo Dodo. This oddball has been chosen by Thelonius Punk to work at the Ivory Tower. Most scholars were shocked to learn the news as the bumbling fey isn’t qualified at all.

      Silly Scholar. Modo Dodo has no qualifications or experience as a scholar. Thelonius knows the ignorant creature will do what he is told. The Academy is now hiring unqualified scholars all the time. The Punks and their leader enjoy the chaos that has overrun the institution.

      Timeless Tenure. This dim-witted fey is confident his position in the Academy is secure. Therefore, the scholar has no incentive to do a good job. He is only there to take advantage of the situation for himself.

      Idol Worship. Modo Dodo is grateful to Thelonius for gifting him his position. The new scholar is enthusiastically preaching the beliefs of the Punks.

    <description>The Punks are a radical faction of the Unseelie Court. They are led by the infamous Thelonius Punk (page 149). These scholars are responsible for the takeover of the Academy by the Unseelie Court.

      Secret Sect. The dark court was unaware of the faction until very recently. These scholars seized control of the Ivory Tower without the approval of the Queen of Darkness.

      Punk Palace. All the Punks now live in the tower near the Well of Dreams. They are making plans to use the Ivory Tower as their headquarters to rule all of Feyland.

      Revolutionary Ideas. These scholars are fanatically loyal to Thelonius and preach his teachings. The Faultless admire and worship the Punks.

    <description>The bravest individuals in the Academy are rogue scholars. They haven’t been corrupted by the Well of Dreams and continue to teach. These fey don’t preach an agenda, they are true scholars.

      Strange Times. With the takeover by the Unseelie Court, things have taken a turn for the worse for these individuals. They have to be constantly on guard. A few of them have even been thrown off the tower.

      Truth Tellers. Rogue scholars do what no other scholars do, they simply teach the truth. They don’t bother with the twisted version of reality that most of the Academy teaches.

      Extraordinary Measures. To protect themselves, these fey have armed themselves and enlisted some of the athletes. Most of the athletes at the Academy play a wild sport called Skyball. Skyballers (page 147) act as bodyguards for the rogue scholars.

    <description>The most dangerous of all the seasonal scholars is this cool, calculating fey. He has his own plans to take over the Academy and then overthrow the leadership of the Unseelie Court.

      Cruel Fool. The Scholar of Winter is also the most heartless of all the scholars. Considering how nasty the others are, this is saying a great deal. Academy Politics. He is part of a plot to seize the

      Ivory Tower. In all the chaos after the Well of Dreams was corrupted, the scholar has gathered a group of conspirators. This gang includes the Dean of Dreams and the Ice Prince.

      Central Chamber. Located deep in the tower is an enchanted chamber with many protective spells. It is near the Well of Dreams and unknown to most of the inhabitants of the Ivory Tower. This is where the scholar lives, far away from most of the Academy.

    <description>One of the many disciplines at the Academy is athletics. A number of fey at the institution play a sport called Skyball. These flying creatures use scoops to pass iron balls and then shoot them into airborne nets.

      Eternally Envious. The skyballers aren’t very popular with the other students at the Academy. The Faultless are extremely jealous of the healthy, good-looking athletes.

      Scary Scholars. For years the institution respected and celebrated these fey. However, the Ivory Tower has become a hostile environment for the skyballers to learn and train. Since the Academy was taken over by the Unseelie Court it’s become a dangerous place for all students except the Faultless.

      Spy Game. Spies from the Seelie Court have already begun to make overtures to the skyballers. The good court want them to join their side and move to the Great Tree.

    <description>For years a faction of the Unseelie Court known as the Punks waited in the shadows. However, that has all changed. Thelonius Punk followed Oswald Myrr in secret to the Well of Dreams. The well’s power has now been released by this scheming fey.

      Avoiding Discomfort. After taking over the Academy, Thelonius has begun to corrupt all of Feyland and spread false beliefs. The first belief is that discomfort must be avoided at all costs.

      Trust Your Feelings. Thelonius pays attention to his feelings and is devoted to them. His second belief is that all other creatures must do the same. This immature individual is known to throw intense tantrums if he doesn’t get his way.

      Righteous War. Thirdly, Thelonius believes creatures are either on the side of truth or not. He wants a war to end the old ways and give power to those who deserve it.
