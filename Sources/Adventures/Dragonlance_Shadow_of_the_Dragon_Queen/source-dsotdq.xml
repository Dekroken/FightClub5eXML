  <description>In a world ravaged by war, the actions of heroes can have world-altering stakes.

Defend the people of Kalaman against seemingly insurmountable odds as Krynn prepares for war. The Dragon Armies are on the march, their ranks swelled by ogres, minotaurs, and humans who seek a share of the spoils, while rumors of the return of the Dark Queen's dragons swirl among the people.

Experience the Dragon Army's initial invasion of the land of Solamnia, witness the creation of the infamous flying citadels, and face off against the death knight, Lord Soth.</description>
